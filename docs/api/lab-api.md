# Lab API — reference

The lab API is the one API over the lab: every lab-level call the console
page, a script, a test or an agent makes goes here, under `/v1` — the
merchants, the clock, settlement runs and what happened, every service's
record and health, and every service's `/sim/*` hooks through one
passthrough. Most routes are a call to one or more services' own HTTP
endpoints; **Reaches** under each route says which, so a caller can go to
the service directly instead. The rest read or write the lab API's own
state: the merchant registry (`console-data/registry.json`), plugin
registrations and stand-in visibility (both in memory).
[README.md](README.md) places this API among the others; the design is
[../lab-api/](../lab-api/README.md).

From the host the base URL is `http://127.0.0.1:8097` (`cmd/labapi`;
`LISTEN`, default `:8097`). The console serves its page on `:8090` and
forwards `/v1` there, so `http://127.0.0.1:8090/v1/…` reaches the same
routes. Requests and answers are JSON, except the connect downloads
(`text/plain` or `application/octet-stream` attachments), the plugin upload
(raw bytes) and whatever a service answers through the passthrough. A body
marked *strict* below is decoded with unknown fields refused, and must be
present: no body is `400 {"error": "EOF"}`, so send `{}` for all defaults.

**Auth and environments.** The lab serves several platforms, each an
*environment* with its own data ([../lab-api/environments.md](../lab-api/environments.md)).
Two kinds of token reach this API:

- **The admin token**, `LAB_API_TOKEN`. It creates environments, reaches
  the lab-wide routes, and acts in any environment by naming it: the
  `Lab-Environment` header (the console's selector sends it), or `?env=`
  on a link or a download. Naming none is the `default` environment, which
  owns everything the lab had before environments, so a call written
  before them answers as it did. `*` names every environment, on the few
  routes that read or reset across them.
- **An environment's token**, `lenv_…`, from `POST /v1/environments`. It
  acts in that environment only: naming another is `403`, and a lab-wide
  route is `403` too.

With no `LAB_API_TOKEN` the lab is open: a call without a token is the
admin's, and an environment's token still scopes the call that carries
one. `GET /health` never asks for a token. The console adds the admin
token for the page when it has the same variable, to every call it
forwards that carries no token; a call that brings one (an environment's)
is forwarded with it, so the console's address scopes it the same way.

Each route's `class` in `GET /v1` says who may call it: `open` (no
token), `any` (any token), `admin` (the admin token only) or `env` (one
environment). Every call the lab API makes to a sim's control port names
the call's environment, so a sim answers with that environment's records
only. A sim that does not keep environments apart yet holds only the
default's: in another environment the passthrough to it is `409`, and the
reads and resets that fan out across the lab leave it out.

**Old paths.** Every route the console served before the lab API existed
still answers at its old `/api` path — `GET /api/overview` is
`GET /v1/lab`, `GET /api` is `GET /v1`, and every other `/api/…` is the
same path under `/v1/…` — because a running plugin registers at
`{console}/api/plugins`. The index lists each route's `alias`. They go in
phase 4 of [the plan](../lab-api/plan.md).

Errors are `{"error": "<message>", "status": <code>}`, the message in the
failing peer's own words where there is one. `400` is something the caller
can fix, `401` a missing or wrong token, `403` a token that may not do this (an
environment's on a lab-wide route, or naming another environment), `404`
an unknown id, `409` a
refusal by state (a plugin stopped, the clock locked), `413` an upload over
the limit, `503` a key file not generated yet. `501` means *does not
exist here by design* (Banking Circle opens no accounts, a service keeps no
activity log, a plugin did not declare that path): not a failure, do not
retry. `502` means an upstream service failed: unreachable (`dial tcp …:
connection refused`), timed out (10 s per call), or refused. A refusal
keeps its message but not its status: B4B's `400` reaches you as `502`.
Routes marked *verbatim*, and the passthrough, are the exception and pass
the upstream's status and body through unchanged. `500` is used only when
a request to a peer cannot be built and should not occur. Views that read
several services (`/v1/lab`, `/v1/banks`, `/v1/config`, `/v1/flow`,
`/v1/stand-ins`) answer `200` with the failure in an error field instead.

## Lab

### `GET /health`

Whether the lab API process is up. Says nothing about the services behind
it; that is `GET /v1/lab`. Open even when `LAB_API_TOKEN` is set.

**Answers** — `200 {"status": "ok", "service": "lab-api"}`

**Reaches** — nothing — the lab API's own state.

### `GET /v1`

The index of this API: every route with its alias, its group, a one-line
summary and what it reaches. Read it first when driving the lab cold; this
document is its long form. Also at `GET /api`.

**Answers** — `200`

```json
{"service": "lab-api", "version": "v1", "build": "3f09c2a1d4e7", "docs": "docs/api/lab-api.md",
 "services": "GET /v1/services lists every service: …", "openapi": "/v1/openapi.json",
 "groups": [{"id": "lab", "title": "Lab", "note": "…"}, …],
 "routes": [{"method": "GET", "path": "/v1/lab", "alias": "/api/overview", "group": "lab",
             "summary": "…", "reaches": "…"}, …]}
```

`build` is a hash of the route table: it changes exactly when the API does.
`openapi` is where the same routes are as an OpenAPI document.
`method` is `ANY` for the passthrough, which takes every method. Group ids,
in order: `lab`, `services`, `clock`, `config`, `merchants`, `banks`,
`actions`, `plugins`, `connect`.

**Reaches** — nothing — the lab API's own state.

### `GET /v1/openapi.json`

This API as an OpenAPI 3.1 document: every route with its summary, its
group as a tag, its path and query parameters, its request body's schema
and its success status, each linked to its section here. What a code
generator or a tool-calling agent reads. The console's old `/api` aliases
are not in it.

It is generated from the route table and an annotation of what each route
takes (`cmd/labapi/openapi.go`); the same document is checked in as
[openapi.yaml](openapi.yaml), and tests hold the two equal and every route
that takes input annotated.

**Answers** — `200` with the document.

**Reaches** — nothing — the lab API's own route table.

### `GET /v1/lab`

Every service in the catalogue, registered plugins first, with its last
health probe. What the Vendors, Platform and Verification views draw.

**Answers** — `200`

```json
{"services": [
   {"id": "b4b", "name": "B4B Payments", "kind": "vendor", "summary": "…",
    "base_url": "http://b4b:8086", "browse_url": "http://127.0.0.1:8086",
    "health_path": "/health", "ports": ["8086/http"], "transport": "HTTP",
    "auth": "Bearer RS512 JWT (aud b4b-payments)", "swap_for": "…", "docs": "…",
    "activity_path": "/sim/activity",
    "endpoints": [{"method": "POST", "path": "/oversight/v1/payments", "note": "pay out (all gates apply)"}, …],
    "status": {"service_id": "b4b", "state": "up", "http_status": 200, "latency_ms": 3,
               "checked_at": "…", "since": "…", "history": [true, true, …]}},
   …],
 "counts": {"up": 12, "unknown": 1},
 "provisioning_ready": true, "provisioning_error": ""}
```

- `kind`: `vendor`, `platform` or `verification`. `state`: `up` (2xx),
  `down` (`detail` says why), `unknown` (not probed yet), `not-probed` (no
  health endpoint). `history` is the last 24 probes, oldest first.
- `base_url` is where the lab API reaches the service (a compose name
  inside the container); `browse_url` is where a browser or a script on the
  host does.
- A plugin also carries `plugin`: `clock`, `start_hint`, `actions`,
  `settlement`, `empty_hints`, `state` (`live`, `lapsed`, `stopped`),
  `registered_at`, `last_seen`, `ttl_seconds`. A stopped plugin, or a
  lapsed one not answering, is reported `unknown` with `detail`
  `registration stopped` / `registration lapsed`.
- A stand-in also carries `stand_in`: `shown`, `set_by`, `set_at`,
  `plays`, `starts_off`.
- `control_url` is the service's control port (`base_url`'s port plus
  1000, plain HTTP): every `/sim/*` route and its own `GET /health`. It is
  where the lab API reaches the service, with no vendor login. A plugin has
  none.
- `provisioning_ready` is true whenever B4B has a control address;
  `provisioning_error` is kept for older pages and is empty.

**Reaches** — nothing at request time. A background monitor probes each
service's control `GET /health` every `CONSOLE_PROBE_INTERVAL` (5 s); a
plugin's `health_path` on its `base_url`.

### `POST /v1/lab/reset`

Put the whole lab back to a known state in one call: every service's
`POST /sim/reset` ([the control contract](README.md#the-control-contract)),
in order, then the lab API's own state.

**Body** — optional, *strict*:

```json
{"scope": "flow", "force": false, "services": ["banking-circle", "b4b"]}
```

- `scope`: `flow` (default) clears what a run makes and keeps what a
  platform set up once — Banking Circle's subscriptions, B4B's boarding,
  Worldline's enrolment, and this API's merchant registry. `all` puts every
  service back as on first start, and clears the merchant registry too.
- `services`: reset only these (any lab service, or `lab-api` for the
  registry); omitted, all of them.
- `force`: reset even while the lab clock is held, and pass `force` to every
  service.

**Order** — producers before consumers, so nothing new arrives at a
service already clean, and the clock last: `worldline`, `aci`, `b4b`,
`banking-circle`, `bank`, `verify`, `verification`, `settlement`,
`receiver`, `payment-api`, `notifier`, `clock`, then `lab-api`. Only
services in the catalogue are called. Plugin registrations and stand-in
switches are never reset: they are live wiring, not run state.

**Answers** — `200` when every part succeeded:

```json
{"scope": "flow", "at": "2026-11-07T12:00:00Z", "ok": true,
 "services": [
   {"service": "worldline", "status": 200, "scope": "flow", "cleared": {"transactions": 120, "files": 2}, "kept": ["enrolment", "channel config"], "at": "…"},
   …,
   {"service": "clock", "status": 200, "scope": "flow", "cleared": {"holds": 0, "changes": 4}, "kept": ["calendars"], "at": "…"},
   {"service": "lab-api", "status": 200, "scope": "flow", "cleared": {}, "kept": ["merchants", "plugins", "stand-ins"]}]}
```

Each entry is the service's own answer with `service` and `status` added.
A failure is reported, not hidden: the entry carries the service's
`status` and `error`, the rest still reset, `ok` is false and the answer is
`502`. A service built before the control contract answers `404`, said as
such. `409` before anything is reset while the lab clock is held — a
settlement run is in flight — naming the holder, unless `force`. `400` for
a scope other than `flow` or `all`, an unknown service, or an unknown
field.

**Reaches** — each service's `POST /sim/reset`; the clock's `GET /clock`
first, for its holds; on `all`, the lab API's merchant registry.

### `GET /v1/logs`

Every service's own log lines ([the control
contract](README.md#the-control-contract)), merged by time: what
`podman logs` on each container would show, through one address.

**Query parameters**

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `services` | comma-separated service ids; omitted, every lab service |
| `q` | case-insensitive substring filter, applied by each service |
| `since` | a previous answer's `next`; omitted, the newest `limit` lines across the lab |
| `limit` | 1–1000, default 200 |

**Answers** — `200`:

```json
{"lines": [
   {"service": "b4b", "seq": 911, "at": "2026-11-07T09:14:01.870Z", "text": "b4b: banking circle bridge call for payment … ok"},
   {"service": "banking-circle", "seq": 1841, "at": "2026-11-07T09:14:02.114Z", "text": "…"}],
 "next": "eyJiNGIiOjkxMSwiYmFua2luZy1jaXJjbGUiOjE4NDF9",
 "dropped": {"b4b": 0, "banking-circle": 0},
 "unreachable": [{"service": "aci", "error": "no GET /sim/logs: a build from before the control contract?"}]}
```

Lines are oldest first. `next` is an opaque cursor holding one position per
service; pass it back as `since` and the next read starts after the last
line each service showed — a page cut at `limit` loses nothing. `since=e30`
(an empty cursor) reads every line each service still holds, from the
start. `dropped` counts, per service, lines after the cursor its ring no
longer holds. A service that does not answer is listed under
`unreachable` and keeps its place in the cursor; the rest still answer.
`400` for an unknown service, a `limit` out of range or a cursor this API
did not give.

**Reaches** — each service's `GET /sim/logs`, in parallel.

### `GET /v1/flow`

The settlement run as a sequence diagram: the participants, one step per
arrow with its counts, the platform's run and a closing report. The
Dashboard polls it every second and diffs the counts between polls.

**Answers** — `200`, always; a service that could not be read is named in
`errors`.

```json
{"participants": [{"id": "platform", "label": "Platform", "role": "system under test",
                   "kind": "platform", "status": "up",
                   "stats": [{"label": "runs", "value": "0"}, …]}, …],
 "steps": [{"id": "payouts", "from": "platform", "to": "b4b", "label": "create payouts",
            "note": "one per merchant settlement", "multi": true, "count": 256, "capped": true,
            "failed": 0, "refused": 0, "last_at": "…", "last_summary": "…",
            "source": "b4b", "source_log": "payments"}, …],
 "run": {"id": "…", "stages": […], "payouts": {"count": 6, "total": "…", "statuses": {…}}},
 "report": [{"label": "files collected", "value": "0"},
            {"label": "stages completed", "value": "0 of 0"}, …],
 "errors": {"infinite-local-runner-status": "Get \"http://…/status\": dial tcp …"},
 "hidden": [{"id": "receiver", "name": "Webhook receiver (platform stand-in)",
             "steps": ["notification batches"], "count": 209}]}
```

- Participants, in this order, left to right: `platform`, `worldline`,
  `b4b`, `banking-circle`, `bank`, `receiver`. The platform's id is always `platform`, labelled with the
  settling plugin's name. `receiver` and its arrow are left out while its
  card is hidden (the default), and counted under `hidden`.
- Step ids, in order: `pull`, `collect`, `ingest`, `fund`, `payouts`,
  `bridge`, `land`, `callbacks`, `notify`, `confirm`, `reports`, `recon`.
  `count` is events in the vendor's window; `capped` means the window was
  full, so the count is a floor. `ingest` and `reports` count the
  platform's run stages, not traffic. `refused` is warn events (for the two
  stage arrows: stages still running).
- `run` is the plugin's `running_now`, else its `last_run`; `null` without
  a settling plugin.
- `errors` is keyed by service id, or `<plugin id>-status` for the status
  read.

**Reaches** — in parallel: `worldline`, `b4b`, `banking-circle`, `bank`
`GET /sim/activity?limit=256`; the settling plugin's `activity_path` and
`settlement.status_path`.

### `GET /v1/flow/hops/{id}`

The events behind one arrow of the diagram, exactly those its count
counted, newest first: the drawer that opens when an arrow is clicked.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a step id from `GET /v1/flow`.

**Answers** — `200`

```json
{"step": {"id": "payouts", "count": 256, …},
 "events": [{"seq": 1016, "at": "…", "op": "payment.create", "summary": "…",
             "status": "ok", "detail": {…}}, …],
 "kept": 100,
 "stages": [{"stage": "SETTLEMENT_FILE_INGESTION", "status": "COMPLETED"}, …],
 "errors": {…}}
```

`step` is the same object `/v1/flow` draws. `events` holds at most 100;
`kept` says how many. `stages` is set only for `ingest` and `reports`, when
the plugin maps them; a stage the run has not reached has `"status": ""`.
`404 {"error": "no hop \"<id>\" in the diagram"}` (no `status` field).
`notify` is served even while the receiver is hidden from `/v1/flow`.

**Reaches** — the same reads as `GET /v1/flow`.

### `GET /v1/stand-ins`

The lab's stand-ins (services that play the platform's part until one
plugs in): whether each card is shown, and how its wiring stands, read live
from the services that own it.

**Answers** — `200`

```json
{"stand_ins": [
   {"id": "settlement", "name": "Settlement (platform stand-in)", "shown": false,
    "set_by": "lab-api", "set_at": "…", "plays": "…",
    "starts_off": "SETTLEMENT_CONNECTED=false on the settlement service",
    "state": "connected",
    "connections": [{"id": "timer", "label": "Worldline pull and cutoff payouts",
                     "connected": true, "detail": "…"}]},
   {"id": "receiver", …,
    "connections": [{"id": "banking-circle", "label": "Banking Circle notifications", …},
                    {"id": "aci", "label": "ACI webhooks", …}]},
   {"id": "payment-api", …, "state": "unwired", "connections": []},
   {"id": "notifier", …}]}
```

`state` is `connected`, `disconnected`, `partial`, `unwired` or `unknown`
(a read failed: see the connection's `error`). A connection's `connected`
is `null` when that wiring does not reach the stand-in in the running lab:
no Banking Circle subscription points at the receiver, or ACI delivers
somewhere else.

**Reaches** — `settlement GET /sim/connected`; `banking-circle GET
/sim/subscriptions` (the subscriptions whose endpoint host is
`receiver`); `aci GET /sim/connected` — each on the service's control
port.

### `POST /v1/stand-ins/{id}`

Show or hide a stand-in's card, and connect or disconnect its wiring.

**Path parameters** — `id`: `settlement`, `receiver`, `payment-api` or
`notifier`.

**Body** — either field or both; other fields are ignored.

```json
{"connected": false, "shown": false}
```

`shown` is the lab API's memory and is lost on a lab API restart;
`connected` is switched where the wiring lives and survives one.
`payment-api` and `notifier` have no wiring: `connected` is accepted and
changes nothing.

**Answers** — `200` with the stand-in read again after the change, shaped
as one entry of `GET /v1/stand-ins`, plus `errors` listing wiring that
did not switch. `502` with the same body when nothing took.
`400 want {"connected": true|false} and/or {"shown": true|false}`;
`404 "<id>" is not a stand-in; the lab's are [...]`.

**Reaches** — on each service's control port: `settlement POST
/sim/connected` `{"connected", "reason"}`; `banking-circle POST
/sim/subscription/{id}/activate` or `/deactivate` per receiver
subscription; `aci POST /sim/connected` (only while ACI delivers to the receiver); then the reads
of `GET /v1/stand-ins`.

## Environments

The platforms the lab serves. An environment is one platform deployment
— sbx, a laptop, an e2e run — with its own token here and its own
customer at every vendor that keeps environments apart: its own Banking
Circle login and safeguarding accounts, its own B4B signing key, its own
SFTP user and folder. `default` is the lab's own, always there, and
cannot be created, changed or deleted. The environments and their tokens
are in the lab's database (`LAB_DB`, default `lab.db` beside the
registry; `off` turns environments off).

An environment is shown as:

```json
{"id": "sbx", "name": "sbx", "config": {"settlement_identifier": "Infinite_Payment",
 "webhook_hosts": ["infinite-sbx-gateway-alb….elb.amazonaws.com"]},
 "created_at": "…", "state": "seen", "last_seen": "…",
 "seen_by": {"banking-circle": "…", "b4b": null, "worldline": "…"},
 "token": "lenv_…", "kit": "/v1/connect/env?env=sbx", "shared": []}
```

- `state` is `never-seen` until a vendor has seen the environment's
  platform log in, then `seen`; `last_seen` is the latest of `seen_by`,
  each vendor's own `GET /sim/customers`. It never turns red with age.
- `token` is shown to the admin and to the environment itself.
- `kit` is its `.env` download: its own logins, its safeguarding account
  ids, and `FINTECH_SIM_LAB_URL`, `FINTECH_SIM_LAB_TOKEN` and
  `FINTECH_SIM_LAB_ENVIRONMENT` for a runner that steers the lab.
- `shared` lists the vendors that do not keep environments apart yet: a
  platform meets the default's data there.
- `config` — `settlement_identifier` (Worldline's file name),
  `webhook_hosts` (callback hosts its subscriptions and callbacks may
  reach, on top of each vendor's allowlist), `aci_webhook_url`,
  `b4b_callback_url`, `clock` (`follows` or `wall`: a seen `wall`
  environment blocks moving the lab clock), `poll_url` and `poll_token`
  (the platform's own Worldline poll, which
  [`POST /v1/platform/poll`](#post-v1platformpoll) calls; the token is
  shown as `(set)` and never handed back), `databases` (the platform's own
  databases by the names the lab's seeder asks for, `platform` and
  `settle`: `postgres://` URLs, shown as `(set)`; a change that leaves
  `databases` out keeps them, and `""` removes one), `tunnel` (the SSH
  jump host those databases are reached through, when the lab cannot reach
  them itself: `{"host", "port" (22), "user", "private_key", "passphrase",
  "password", "host_key"}`. `private_key` is a PEM key (OpenSSH, PKCS#1 or
  PKCS#8), opened with `passphrase` when it is encrypted, and checked when
  the config is saved; `password` is tried with it, or alone; `host_key`
  pins the jump host's key as `ssh-keygen -lf` prints it (`SHA256:…`), and
  empty accepts any. The three secrets are shown as `(set)`, and a change
  keeps them as [`PATCH`](#patch-v1environmentsid) says). All optional.

With a `tunnel`, every seeder call opens it for as long as the call takes:
the lab connects to the jump host, forwards a port of its own on
`127.0.0.1` to each database the call hands over, and gives the seeder
each database's own URL with the forward's address in it (the seeder runs
in the lab's pod). Without one, the URLs go to the seeder as they are.

The lab API pushes each environment to every vendor that keeps them
apart when it is created or changed, and checks every few seconds
(`LAB_SYNC_INTERVAL`, default `5s`) that each vendor has exactly the
environments the database has, so a vendor that restarted gets its
customers back. A vendor whose `GET /sim/info` `started_at` moved (it
restarted), or that the lab API has not synced since its own start, is
given every environment again, the ones it lists included: Banking Circle
keeps its customers on disk, and one changed while it was down would
otherwise stay as it was.

### `GET /v1/environment`

The environment this call is in: an environment token's own, or the one
the admin names (`default` when none).

**Answers** — `200` with one environment; `400` for `*`.

**Reaches** — the lab's database and each vendor's control
`GET /sim/customers`.

### `GET /v1/environments`

Every environment, `default` first, for the admin; the caller's own for
an environment's token.

**Answers** — `200 {"environments": [ … ]}`.

**Reaches** — the lab's database and each vendor's control
`GET /sim/customers`.

### `POST /v1/environments`

Create an environment. *Admin.*

**Body** — `{"name": "Infinite sbx", "id": "sbx", "config": {…}}`; `id`
defaults to the name made lower-case with dashes, `config` to `{}`.

**Answers** — `201 {"environment": {…}, "token": "lenv_…", "pushed":
{"banking-circle": "ok", …}}`: `pushed` is how each vendor took the new
customer (one that is down gets it from the sync once it is back). `400`
for an id that is not lower-case letters, digits and dashes, is `default`
or `*`, or for a bad config; `409` for an id taken; `503` when the lab has
no database. A new environment starts with no settlement files: any an
earlier environment of that id left on the lab's volume are removed.

**Reaches** — the lab's database and volume; each vendor's control
`PUT /sim/customers/{env}`.

### `GET /v1/environments/{id}`

One environment. An environment's token reads only its own (`404`
otherwise).

**Answers** — `200` with the environment; `404`.

**Reaches** — the lab's database and each vendor's control
`GET /sim/customers`.

### `PATCH /v1/environments/{id}`

Rename an environment or change its config. *Admin.*

**Body** — `{"name": "…", "config": {…}}`, either. `config` names only
what changes: a setting it leaves out keeps its value, one it sends
replaces it, and `""`, `[]` or `null` clears it. So registering an
environment's databases and jump host is

```json
{"config": {"databases": {"platform": "postgres://…", "settle": "postgres://…"},
            "tunnel": {"host": "34.240.176.175", "user": "jumpuser", "private_key": "-----BEGIN …"}}}
```

and leaves its settlement identifier, webhook hosts and poll alone. A
secret sent back as the view shows it, `(set)`, keeps its value
(`poll_token`, a database, the tunnel's `private_key`, `passphrase` and
`password`); a database sent as `""` is removed and one left out is kept; a
`tunnel` that is sent changes only the fields it names, and `null` removes
it. For `default`, only `config` can be set, and only its `poll_url`,
`poll_token`, `databases`, `tunnel` and `clock`: its vendor settings are the
lab's deployment.

**Answers** — `200 {"environment": {…}, "pushed": {…}}` (no `pushed` for
`default`); `400` for a bad config, a rename of `default`, or a vendor
setting on `default`; `404`.

**Reaches** — the lab's database; each vendor's control
`PUT /sim/customers/{env}`.

### `DELETE /v1/environments/{id}`

Delete an environment: every vendor forgets its customer and everything
it made, then its plugins, its merchant registry, its token and its
settlement files on the lab's volume go. *Admin.*

**Answers** — `200 {"deleted": "sbx", "vendors": {"banking-circle":
"removed", …}, "files_deleted": 3}`, with `files_error` when the files
could not be removed (the environment is gone all the same, and creating
one under that id removes them); `502` with the same `vendors` when one
could not be reached, and then nothing else was removed — call again.
`400` for `default`; `404`.

**Reaches** — each vendor's control `DELETE /sim/customers/{env}`; the
lab's database and volume.

### `POST /v1/environments/{id}/token`

Give an environment a new token; the old one stops working at once.
*Admin.*

**Answers** — `200 {"id": "sbx", "token": "lenv_…"}`; `400` for `default`
(its token is the admin's); `404`.

**Reaches** — the lab's database.

## Platform card

Every environment's card ([../lab-api/plan.md, phase
6](../lab-api/plan.md#phase-6--the-platform-card-is-the-environments)): its
settlement files, kept by the lab per environment on its own volume
(`<CONSOLE_STATE_FILE's directory>/files/<env>/`); publishing them at
Worldline, in the environment's SFTP folder, as the morning's file; and the
platform's own poll, called now rather than at its next window. All in the
call's environment; none takes `*`.

A file is shown as:

```json
{"name": "Infinite_Payment_ER_20261110093000_EUR.csv", "source": "generated",
 "bytes": 4210, "modified": "…", "currency": "EUR", "mids": ["6001…"],
 "total": "4394.87", "items": 30}
```

`source` is `generated` (the platform's seeder made it for the
environment's seeded merchants), `cut` (Worldline cut it from the lab's own
trading) or `uploaded`. A file is read row by row for its summary, so a file
of millions of transactions is listed without being held in memory. A file
Worldline's parser refuses has no currency and a `problem` instead, and
cannot be published.

The platform's side of the card is its **seeder**: a container in the lab's
pod, built from the platform's own repository (`LAB_SEEDER_URL`; none, and
seeding is off). It seeds the environment's databases, which its config
names, with generated merchants, and writes settlement files for them onto
the lab's volume. The lab knows no platform: any seeder serving `GET /info`
(`{"databases": [names]}`), `POST /seed` and `POST /settlement-files` fits.

### `GET /v1/settlement-files`

The environment's files, newest first.

**Answers** — `200 {"env": "sbx", "files": [ … ]}`.

**Reaches** — the lab API's own volume.

### `POST /v1/settlement-files`

Upload a file: the raw bytes, streamed, kept under `?name=` (letters,
digits, `.`, `-`, `_`), capped at `CONSOLE_UPLOAD_MAX_MB` (512).

**Answers** — `201 {"file": {…}, "note": "…"}`, the note saying what the
parser made of it; `400` for a bad name or an empty file; `409` for the
name of a generated file; `413` over the cap.

**Reaches** — the lab API's own volume.

### `POST /v1/settlement-files/generate`

Have the platform's seeder write settlement files for the environment's
seeded merchants (`POST /v1/platform/seed`) straight into its files: a
Worldline ER file per currency, every generated outlet in it. The seeder
streams them to disk, so millions of transactions are fine.

**Body** — `{"transactions": 1000, "currency": "EUR", "seed": null}`;
`currency` empty for a file per currency, `seed` to replay.

**Answers** — `201 {"env", "result": {…the seeder's answer…}, "files": [
…as listed…]}`; `409` when the environment's config names no database the
seeder needs; `502` when its `tunnel` cannot be opened or does not reach a
database; `503` when the lab runs no seeder; the seeder's own status and
reason otherwise.

**Reaches** — the seeder's `POST /settlement-files`.

### `POST /v1/settlement-files/cut`

Keep the file Worldline would cut from the environment's trading in the
lab, without publishing it: for a platform with no seeder, or a file whose
MIDs the platform need not know.

**Body** — `{"currency": "EUR", "date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "slot": "ER"}`;
`date` and `slot` default as the cycle does (T+1, the morning).

**Answers** — `201 {"file": {…}}`; Worldline's `404` when nothing settles,
with its reason.

**Reaches** — worldline `POST /sim/settlement-files/render`.

### `GET /v1/settlement-files/preview`

The first lines of one file: `?name=`, `?lines=` (1 to 1000, default 100).

**Answers** — `200 {"name", "lines": […], "truncated", "long_lines",
"bytes"}`; `404`.

**Reaches** — the lab API's own volume.

### `GET /v1/settlement-files/download`

One file whole, `?name=`, as a download (`Content-Disposition: attachment`,
named as it is listed). A link can carry the environment as `?env=`.

**Answers** — `200` `text/csv`, the file's bytes (ranges honoured); `404`.

**Reaches** — the lab API's own volume.

### `DELETE /v1/settlement-files`

Delete one file, `?name=`.

**Answers** — `204`; `404`.

**Reaches** — the lab API's own volume.

### `POST /v1/settlement-files/publish`

Have Worldline publish files in the environment's SFTP download folder,
plain as its own, under its own naming. The platform's next
poll picks them up, or `POST /v1/platform/poll` asks it now.

**Body** — `{"files": ["…EUR…", "…GBP…"], "wire": true}`: at most one
file per currency (a platform settles two currencies at once, never two
files of one). `wire` (default `true`) wires each ER file's total to the
environment's safeguarding account, as Worldline's morning does.

**Answers** — `200 {"env", "published": 2, "results": [{…Worldline's
answer…, "file"}, …], "note"}`: each result is Worldline's answer (its
`name` and `published` path: a file named as Worldline names its own is
published under the environment's settlement identifier and the moment's
timestamp, since a platform's poll takes only its own identifier's files of
its own day) with `file`, the lab's copy; a result with `error` for
a file that did not publish; `502` when none did; `400` for a file the parser refuses;
`404` for one the environment does not have; `409` for two of one
currency.

**Reaches** — worldline `POST /sim/settlement-files/publish`, per file.

### `GET /v1/platform`

What the environment's card can do on the platform's side.

**Answers** — `200 {"env", "seeder": {"available": true, "info": {…}} or
{"available": false, "error"}, "databases": {"platform": "set", "settle":
"missing"}, "tunnel": {"host": "bastion.example:22", "user", "host_key"}
or null, "poll": true}`.

**Reaches** — the seeder's `GET /info`; the lab's database.

### `POST /v1/platform/check`

Check the lab reaches each database the environment names, through its
jump host when it has one: what registering an environment's databases
wants to know before a seed. It connects to the jump host, then opens a
connection to each database through it (or straight to it, without a
tunnel) and closes it again; it never logs in to a database, whose
credentials are the seeder's to try. Needs no seeder.

**Answers** — `200 {"env", "tunnel": {"host", "user", "host_key": "SHA256:…
(the key it met)", "status": "ok" or why not} or null, "databases":
{"platform": "reachable", "settle": "…:5432 does not answer: …"}}`; every
database is `not checked` when the jump host is not reached. `409` when
the config names no database.

**Reaches** — the environment's jump host and databases (TCP only).

### `POST /v1/platform/seed`

Seed the environment's databases with generated merchants, boarded and
active, with their pricing, in the platform's database, and their accounts
in the settle database: what buddy's runner's *Seed merchants* did, for any
environment whose config names its databases.

**Body** — `{"merchants": 50, "mode": "add", "files": "delete", "seed":
null}`: `mode` is `add` (keep the generated merchants there), `reseed`
(remove every generated merchant first) or `remove`; `files` says what
happens to the environment's `generated` settlement files on a reseed or a
removal, since they pay MIDs that no longer exist.

**Answers** — `200 {"env", "result": {…the seeder's answer…},
"files_deleted"}`; `409` when the config names no database the seeder
needs; `502` when its `tunnel` cannot be opened or does not reach a
database, with the reason; `503` when the lab runs no seeder; the seeder's
own status and reason otherwise (`409` while it is busy with these
databases).

**Reaches** — the seeder's `POST /seed`.

### `POST /v1/platform/poll`

Run the platform's own Worldline poll now: `POST` to the `poll_url` the
environment's config names, with `Authorization: Bearer <poll_token>` and
the body below. The platform downloads what Worldline has published and
starts its settlement, as its scheduled poll would.

**Body** — `{"fileType": "ER"}`, or `"AR"` for the afternoon file.

**Answers** — *verbatim*: the platform's status and body. `409` when the
environment has no `poll_url`; `502` when it cannot be reached (90 s).

**Reaches** — the environment's `poll_url`.

## Services

### `GET /v1/services`

Every service, the lab's own and the registered plugins, each as one entry
of `services` in `GET /v1/lab`: its catalogue record (`base_url`,
`browse_url`, `auth`, `endpoints`, …) and its last health probe in
`status`.

**Answers** — `200 {"services": [ … ]}`

**Reaches** — nothing at request time; the background monitor probes each
service's control `GET /health`.

### `GET /v1/services/{id}`

One service, shaped as an entry of `GET /v1/services`.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a catalogue id or a registered plugin's id.

**Answers** — `200` with the entry. `404 unknown service <id>`.

**Reaches** — nothing at request time.

### `POST /v1/services/{id}/probe`

Probe one service's health now instead of waiting for the next tick.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a catalogue id (`worldline`, `b4b`,
`banking-circle`, `aci`, `bank`, `verify`, `verification`, `clock`,
`settlement`, `receiver`, `payment-api`, `notifier`) or a registered
plugin's id.

**Answers** — `200` with the new status, shaped as `status` in
`GET /v1/lab`. A service that is down is still `200`, with
`"state": "down"`. `404 unknown service <id>`.

**Reaches** — the service's `GET {control_url}/health`; a plugin's
`GET {base_url}{health_path}`.

### `GET /v1/services/{id}/activity`

One service's recent traffic, from its own activity rings: the panels on
its card.

**Path / query parameters** — `id`: as for the probe. `limit`: events per
log, passed through (the service's default is 100; rings hold 256).

**Answers** — `200`, the service's body:

```json
{"logs": [{"name": "payments", "title": "Payouts received", "note": "…",
           "total": 1016, "kept": 256, "last": {…},
           "events": [{"seq": 1016, "at": "2026-11-05T22:47:50.5Z", "op": "payment.create",
                       "peer": "10.0.2.100", "summary": "payout 323.32 GBP to …",
                       "status": "ok", "detail": {"amount": "323.32 GBP", …}}, …]}, …]}
```

`status` is `ok`, `warn` or `bad`. Errors: `404 unknown service <id>`;
`501 <name> keeps no activity log` for `aci`, `verify`, `verification`,
`settlement`, `receiver` and a plugin without `activity_path`; `502` when
the service cannot be read (a non-2xx arrives as `GET <url>: HTTP <code>`,
its body dropped).

**Reaches** — the service's `GET /sim/activity?limit=` on its control
port; for a plugin, `base_url` + `activity_path`.

### `GET /v1/services/{id}/logs`

One service's own log lines: its `GET /sim/logs`, query and answer as they
are ([the control contract](README.md#the-control-contract)). The same
call as `/v1/services/{id}/sim/logs`.

**Answers** — *verbatim*: the service's `{"service", "lines", "next",
"dropped"}`. `404 no lab service <id>`; `502` when it cannot be reached.

**Reaches** — the service's `GET /sim/logs`.

### `POST /v1/services/{id}/reset`

Reset one service: its `POST /sim/reset`, body and answer as they are
(`{"scope": "flow"|"all", "force": false}`). Unlike
`POST /v1/lab/reset`, it does not ask the clock first: a service that
cannot reset safely says so itself, with `409`.

**Answers** — *verbatim*: the service's `{"service", "scope", "cleared",
"kept", "at"}`, or its `400`/`409`/`500`. `404 no lab service <id>`; `502`
when it cannot be reached.

**Reaches** — the service's `POST /sim/reset`.

### `ANY /v1/services/{id}/sim/{path...}`

The passthrough: any of a service's `/sim/*` lab hooks, through the one
address, on the service's control port. Method, query and body go to the
service as sent; its status, `Content-Type` and
body come back as it gave them. A hook a service gains is reachable here
the moment it exists.

```sh
curl -s -XPOST localhost:8097/v1/services/worldline/sim/settlement-cycle/run?slot=morning
curl -s -XPOST localhost:8097/v1/services/banking-circle/sim/subscription/sub_1/pause
curl -s -XPUT  localhost:8097/v1/services/b4b/sim/beneficiaries/ben_1/sanctions -d '{"status":"fail"}'
curl -s -XPOST localhost:8097/v1/services/kyc6/sim/outcome -d '{…}'
```

**Path parameters** — `id`: a catalogue id (not a plugin's: a platform's
own hooks are its declared actions). `path`: the rest of the service's
`/sim/…` path, escaping kept.

**Headers carried on** — `Content-Type`, `Accept`, `If-Match`,
`If-None-Match`. The caller's `Authorization` is not: it was for the lab
API, and a control port asks for none — no vendor login, Banking Circle's
and B4B's included. The vendors' credentials are the platform's.

**Answers** — *verbatim*: whatever the service answered. `404 no lab
service <id>`. `502` when the service's control port cannot be reached.
Bodies up to 32 MB.

**Reaches** — `{method} {control_url}/sim/{path}?{query}`. Each
service's hooks are in its reference, [services/](services/), under *Lab
control*.

## Traps

A trap is an instruction armed in advance in one simulation: it decides
something about a future event at one of that simulation's hooks — which
outcome a payout takes, and when. It is armed where it applies, through the
passthrough, and read here across the lab. The model, the hooks and their
graphs are in [README.md](README.md#traps) and each service's reference.

```sh
# what can be trapped, and how
curl -s localhost:8097/v1/traps/hooks
# Banking Circle: a payout to this IBAN is processed, then reversed ten seconds later
curl -s -XPOST localhost:8097/v1/services/banking-circle/sim/traps -d '{
  "label": "merchant 7: processed, then reversed",
  "hook": "payment.outgoing",
  "match": {"creditor.iban": "GB00SIM0000000000777"},
  "effect": {"path": [{"to": "OutgoingPaymentProcessed"},
                      {"to": "Reversed", "after": "10s", "reason": "scheme"}]}}'
# did it fire?
curl -s localhost:8097/v1/services/banking-circle/sim/traps/trp_0001
```

### `GET /v1/traps`

Every simulation's traps, each with its `service`, newest first.

**Query parameters** — `state`: `armed`, `spent`, `expired` or
`disarmed`.

**Answers** — `200 {"traps": [{"service": "banking-circle", "id":
"trp_0001", "hook": "payment.outgoing", "state": "spent", "caught": […],
"pending_steps": […], …}, …], "unreachable": [{"service", "error"}]}`.
A simulation with no hooks is left out; one that cannot be reached is
listed under `unreachable`. `400` for a bad `state`, in the simulation's
words.

**Reaches** — each service's control `GET /sim/traps`, in parallel.

### `GET /v1/traps/hooks`

Every simulation's hook catalogue, each hook with its `service`: its
subject, the fields a trap can match on, its effect and, for a lifecycle,
the graph of states that may follow each other and each state's
parameters. What an agent reads before arming anything; a hook not listed
here does not exist.

**Answers** — `200 {"hooks": [{"service": "banking-circle", "hook":
"payment.outgoing", "about": "…", "subject": "payment_id", "match": […],
"effect": "path", "graph": {…}, "first_step_default_after": "2s"}, …],
"unreachable": […]}`.

**Reaches** — each service's control `GET /sim/traps/hooks`, in parallel.

### `DELETE /v1/traps`

Disarm every trap in the lab and cancel the steps still waiting. Standing
traps (a simulation's own, from its configuration) are disarmed too, until
its next reset arms them again.

**Answers** — `200 {"ok": true, "services": [{"service", "status",
"disarmed", "cancelled": [{"trap_id", "subject", "step", "due"}]}]}`;
`502` with `"ok": false` when a simulation could not be reached, the rest
still disarmed.

**Reaches** — each service's control `DELETE /sim/traps`, in parallel.

## Clock

### `GET /v1/clock`

The lab clock as it stands: the lab's now, its offset from real time, its
mode, each calendar's business day and any holds.

**Answers** — `200`, the clock service's body:

```json
{"offset_ms": -46018278, "offset_hours": -12.78, "now": "2026-11-06T23:25:52.46Z",
 "mode": "pinned", "pinned": true, "reason": "pinned to 2026-11-05T10:00:00Z",
 "changed_at": "…", "business_day": false,
 "calendars": [{"code": "GB", "zone": "Europe/London", "date": "2026-11-06",
                "weekday": "Fri", "business_day": true}, …],
 "holds": [{"holder": "infinite-local-runner", "reason": "…", "until": "…"}]}
```

`mode` is `real`, `pinned` or `auto-business-day`. `502` when the clock
cannot be read.

A lab deployed without a clock (`CONSOLE_URL_CLOCK=off`, the cloud profile
in [../deploy-cloud.md](../deploy-cloud.md)) answers `200` with the real
time and that there is nothing to move — no `business_day`, since the
calendars are the clock service's:

```json
{"absent": true, "mode": "real", "offset_ms": 0, "offset_hours": 0,
 "now": "2026-11-07T10:00:00Z", "note": "This lab runs without a lab clock, …"}
```

**Reaches** — `clock GET /clock`.

### `POST /v1/clock`

Move the lab clock, or change its mode. Every vendor follows within a
second, and so does a plugin registered with `"clock": "follows"`.

**Body** — forwarded *verbatim* (up to 8 KiB): exactly one of

```json
{"at": "2026-09-28T07:45:00Z"}
{"advance": "1d"}
{"mode": "real"}
{"mode": "auto-business-day"}
```

plus an optional `"reason"`. `advance` is a number and `d`, `h` or `m`:
`"1d"`, `"-90m"`, `"1.5h"`.

**Answers** — *verbatim* from the clock: `200` with the new clock (as
`GET /v1/clock`); `400` with its reason (no field, two fields, a bad
timestamp); `409 clock is held: …` while a run holds it. The lab API
answers `409` itself, without calling the clock, while a live plugin is
registered with `"clock": "wall"`: `<name> is registered on the wall
clock and cannot follow the lab's; …`. `502` when the clock is unreachable.
That refusal is the lab API's own: a `POST` straight to the clock service
still moves it. `501` on a lab deployed without a clock: there is nothing
to move.

**Reaches** — `clock POST /clock`.

### `POST /v1/clock/holds`

Hold the lab clock while a run is in flight: until the hold is released or
lapses, every move is refused with the clock's `409`. A run that holds the
clock through the lab API holds the same clock its vendors follow.

**Body** — the clock's own: `{"holder": "runner", "reason": "settlement run", "ttl_seconds": 600}`
([services/clock.md](services/clock.md)).

**Answers** — *verbatim*: the clock service's status and body. `501` on a
lab deployed without a clock.

**Reaches** — clock `POST /clock/holds`.

### `DELETE /v1/clock/holds/{holder}`

Release a hold.

**Path parameters** — `holder`: the holder named when it was taken.

**Answers** — *verbatim*: the clock service's status and body. `404` on a
lab deployed without a clock: there is no such hold.

**Reaches** — clock `DELETE /clock/holds/{holder}`.

## Configuration

### `GET /v1/config`

What the lab is set to: the documented environment knobs, Banking Circle's
notification delivery table, and Worldline's file-exchange channel.

**Answers** — `200`, always:

```json
{"groups": [{"title": "Worldline -- the settlement cycle", "note": "…",
             "settings": [{"key": "WORLDLINE_FILE_SOURCE", "service": "worldline",
                           "purpose": "…", "configured": "generate"}, …]},
            …,
            {"title": "The lab API", "note": "…",
             "settings": [{"key": "LISTEN", "service": "lab-api", "purpose": "…",
                           "configured": "", "live": ":8090"}, …]}],
 "banking_circle": {"retry_schedule": [{"after": "15s"}, {"after": "…", "email": "warning"}, …],
                    "time_scale": 86400, "deactivate_after_retries": 11,
                    "batch_flush_interval": "2s", "default_max_notifications_per_message": 1000,
                    "request_timeout": "10s"},
 "banking_circle_path": "/config/banking-circle.json",
 "banking_circle_source": "live from banking-circle (the file plus any BC_TIME_SCALE override)",
 "worldline_channel": {"merchant_id": "GB00SIM0000000000003", "sftp_directory": "…",
                       "report_types": ["WX", …], "report_formats": ["CSV", …],
                       "cut_off_time": "00:00 CET", "remittance_frequency": "daily",
                       "sftp_directory_count": 3}}
```

- `configured` is what compose.yml ships: documentation, not a reading of
  the running container. `live` is set only for the lab API's own
  variables; one that looks like a credential reads `(set, hidden)`.
- `banking_circle` is the table Banking Circle is running. When it cannot
  be asked, it is the file at `CONSOLE_BC_DELIVERY_CONFIG`, with
  `banking_circle_source` saying so, and `banking_circle_note` when the file
  is unreadable and the built-in defaults are shown. `banking_circle_error`
  replaces all of it when the file does not parse.
- `worldline_channel_error` replaces `worldline_channel` when Worldline
  cannot be read, including `HTTP 404` before any channel config has been
  saved.

**Reaches** — `banking-circle GET /sim/delivery-config`, or the config
file; `worldline GET /sim/config` (the same answer as its `GET /config`) —
each on its control port.

### `PUT /v1/config/worldline-channel`

Change Worldline's SFT file-exchange channel config, the one setting the
lab API changes live.

**Body** — forwarded *verbatim*; Worldline decodes it strictly and stores
it whole, so a field left out is cleared.

```json
{"merchant_id": "GB00SIM0000000000003", "sftp_directory": "/sftp/outbound/GB00SIM0000000000003",
 "report_types": ["WX", "Financial"], "report_formats": ["CSV", "XML", "ASCII"],
 "cut_off_time": "00:00 CET", "remittance_frequency": "daily", "sftp_directory_count": 3}
```

`merchant_id` is required.

**Answers** — *verbatim* from Worldline: `200` with the saved config;
`400` with its reason (`merchant_id required`, `json: unknown field …`).
The lab API answers `400 body must be JSON: …` for a body it cannot parse,
and `502` when Worldline is unreachable.

**Reaches** — `worldline PUT /sim/config` on its control port (the same
handler as its `PUT /config`).

## Merchants

### `GET /v1/merchants`

The lab's merchant registry (distributor → partner → merchant →
outlet), its batches, and the countries it dresses merchants in. A
platform that settles these merchants seeds its own records from this.

**Answers** — `200`

```json
{"distributors": [{"id": "dst_0001", "name": "Simulator Distribution Ltd", "country": "GB",
                   "created_at": "…"}],
 "partners": [{"id": "prt_0002", "distributor_id": "dst_0001",
               "name": "Northwind Partner Services", "country": "NL", "created_at": "…"}],
 "merchants": [{"id": "mer_0003", "partner_id": "prt_0002", "legal_name": "Copperleaf Bakery Ltd",
                "trading_name": "Copperleaf Bakery", "country": "GB", "currency": "GBP",
                "mcc": "5462", "address": {"line1": "…", "city": "London", "post_code": "…", "country": "GB"},
                "email": "…", "status": "active", "batch": "bat_0004",
                "outlets": [{"id": "out_0005", "mid": "…", "name": "Copperleaf Bakery - outlet 1",
                             "address": {…}, "terminal_id": "…", "mcc": "5462",
                             "account_name": "Copperleaf Bakery", "account_number": "…",
                             "financial_institution": "…",
                             "beneficiary_id": "…", "sanctions_status": "pass"}],
                "created_at": "…"}, …],
 "batches": [{"id": "bat_0004", "seed": 42, "count": 50, "max_outlets": 3, "created_at": "…"}],
 "countries": [{"code": "GB", "name": "United Kingdom", "currency": "GBP"}, …],
 "provisioning_ready": true, "provisioning_error": ""}
```

An outlet has `beneficiary_id` and `sanctions_status` once registered at
B4B. Ids come from one counter: `dst_`, `prt_`, `mer_`, `out_`, `bat_`
and four digits. Countries: GB, NL, DE, FR, IE, ES, SE, PL.

**Reaches** — nothing — the lab API's own state.

### `POST /v1/merchants`

Create a merchant and its opening outlets. Everything except `legal_name`
is optional and derived from the merchant's id when left out: address,
MCC, email, and per outlet a MID, terminal id and payout account.

**Body** — strict.

```json
{"legal_name": "Harbour Coffee Ltd", "trading_name": "Harbour Coffee", "partner_id": "prt_0002",
 "country": "GB", "currency": "GBP", "mcc": "5814", "email": "",
 "address": {"line1": "1 Ledger Lane", "line2": "", "city": "London", "post_code": "E1 6AN", "country": "GB"},
 "outlets": 2}
```

- `legal_name` is required. `outlets` is 0 to 20; 0 means 1.
- `country` is a code from the countries list; anything else is replaced
  by a derived country without an error. `currency` defaults to the
  country's.
- `address` is used only when `line1` is set.

**Answers** — `201` with the merchant, shaped as in `GET /v1/merchants`.
`400` for a missing `legal_name`, `outlets` out of range, or a bad body;
`404` for an unknown `partner_id`.

**Reaches** — nothing — the lab API's own state.

### `DELETE /v1/merchants/{id}`

Delete a merchant from the registry. Nothing registered at B4B or seeded at
Worldline is undone: B4B has no beneficiary-delete endpoint.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a merchant id.

**Answers** — `200 {"deleted": "mer_0003"}`; `404`.

**Reaches** — nothing — the lab API's own state.

### `POST /v1/merchants/batches`

Generate many merchants at once, drawn from a seed: names, trades and
their MCCs, countries, company forms, outlet counts. The same seed makes
the same population again, with new ids and so new MIDs.

**Body** — strict.

```json
{"count": 50, "max_outlets": 3, "country": "", "seed": 42, "partner_id": ""}
```

- `count`: 1 to 500, required.
- `max_outlets`: 1 to 10; absent or 0 means 3. Most merchants get one.
- `country`: empty mixes the EUR and GBP countries (the currencies Banking
  Circle holds safeguarding accounts in); a code from the countries list
  puts every merchant there; anything else is `400`.
- `seed`: optional; without it the seed derives from the batch's id.
- `partner_id`: optional; must exist.

**Answers** — `201`

```json
{"batch": {"id": "bat_0007", "seed": 42, "count": 50, "max_outlets": 3, "created_at": "…"},
 "merchants": 50, "outlets": 71,
 "note": "50 merchants, 71 outlets — seed 42 makes the same names again."}
```

`400` for the validation above; `404` for an unknown `partner_id`.

**Reaches** — nothing — the lab API's own state.

### `DELETE /v1/merchants/batches/{id}`

Delete a batch and every merchant in it, from the registry only. B4B and
Worldline keep what they were sent.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a batch id.

**Answers** — `200 {"deleted": "bat_0007", "merchants": 50}`; `404`.

**Reaches** — nothing — the lab API's own state.

### `POST /v1/merchants/batches/{id}/provision`

Register every outlet of a batch as a B4B beneficiary, merchant by
merchant: `POST /v1/merchants/{id}/provision` for the whole batch.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a batch id.

**Answers** — `200`, reported per merchant; a partial run is still `200`.

```json
{"merchants": 50, "done": 49,
 "failed": ["mer_0012: 1 of 2 outlet(s) refused — POST /oversight/v1/beneficiaries: HTTP 422: …"],
 "note": "49 of 50 merchants on the payout rail, 70 outlet(s) registered at B4B"}
```

`404` for an unknown batch. An outlet B4B refuses, or a B4B control port
that does not answer, is reported per outlet. The whole batch may take up
to two minutes.

**Reaches** — `b4b POST /sim/beneficiaries` on its control port, once per
outlet: the same registration, answer and callbacks as its Oversight
`POST /oversight/v1/beneficiaries`, with no JWT.

### `POST /v1/merchants/batches/{id}/trading`

Seed card payments at Worldline for every outlet of a batch. Each merchant
trades at its own typical ticket (3.00 to 150.00, derived from its id)
unless `amount_cents` is given.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a batch id.

**Body** — strict; the fields of `POST /v1/merchants/{id}/trading`.

```json
{"count": 5}
```

**Answers** — `201`, reported per merchant:

```json
{"merchants": 50, "done": 50,
 "note": "355 card payment(s) at Worldline for 50 of 50 merchants, dated 2026-11-06 — Worldline settles T+1: run its morning cycle to have them in a settlement file."}
```

`failed` lists merchants Worldline refused, or whose parameters were
invalid (`count` over 200); the answer is still `201`. `400` for a bad
body; `404` for an unknown batch.

**Reaches** — `worldline POST /sim/transactions`, once per merchant.

### `POST /v1/merchants/{id}/outlets`

Open another outlet, with a new MID, for a merchant. It is not known to
B4B until the merchant is provisioned again.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a merchant id.

**Body** — strict.

```json
{"name": "Harbour Coffee - Quayside"}
```

`name` may be empty: it then becomes `<merchant> - outlet <n>`.

**Answers** — `201 {"merchant": {…}, "outlet": {"id": "out_0009", "mid": "…", …}}`;
`404` for an unknown merchant.

**Reaches** — nothing — the lab API's own state.

### `POST /v1/merchants/{id}/status`

Set a merchant's status. Registry-only: nothing in the lab acts on it.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a merchant id.

**Body** — strict.

```json
{"status": "suspended"}
```

`status` is `draft`, `active` or `suspended`.

**Answers** — `200` with the merchant; `400` for any other status; `404`.

**Reaches** — nothing — the lab API's own state.

### `POST /v1/merchants/{id}/provision`

Register each outlet of a merchant as a B4B beneficiary, keyed on its MID
(`external_ref`), and record the beneficiary id and sanctions status on the
outlet. Safe to repeat: B4B corrects the record for a repeated
`external_ref` rather than creating a second payee.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a merchant id.

**Answers** — `200`, per outlet, whether or not each worked:

```json
{"outlets": [{"outlet_id": "out_0005", "mid": "…", "beneficiary_id": "…", "sanctions_status": "pass"},
             {"outlet_id": "out_0006", "mid": "…",
              "error": "POST /oversight/v1/beneficiaries: HTTP 422: …"}]}
```

`404` for an unknown merchant.

**Reaches** — `b4b POST /sim/beneficiaries` on its control port, per
outlet, `{"external_ref", "account_name", "account_number",
"financial_institution", "country"}` — the Oversight API's registration,
with no JWT.

### `POST /v1/merchants/{id}/trading`

Tell Worldline the merchant's outlets took card payments. This is the
acquirer's own data: the platform learns of it only through the next
settlement file.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a merchant id.

**Body** — strict; `{}` for all defaults.

```json
{"count": 5, "amount_cents": 2500, "currency": "GBP", "date": "2026-11-06"}
```

- `count`: payments per outlet; default 3, at most 200.
- `amount_cents`: default 2500.
- `currency`: default the merchant's.
- `date`: `YYYY-MM-DD`, passed to Worldline unchecked. The default is
  yesterday (UTC) on the real clock, not the lab clock: with the lab clock
  moved, give `date` so the next cycle covers it.

**Answers** — `201`

```json
{"accepted": 10, "date": "2026-11-06",
 "note": "Worldline settles T+1: run the morning cycle to have these appear in a settlement file."}
```

`400` for `count` over 200, a merchant with no outlets, or a bad body;
`404`; `502` when Worldline refuses or is unreachable.

**Reaches** — `worldline POST /sim/transactions`: one array, `count`
entries per outlet, each `{"mid", "currency", "amount_cents", "date",
"mcc", "terminal_id"}`.

### `POST /v1/outlets/{mid}/sanctions`

Move an outlet's beneficiary at B4B between `pass`, `review` and `fail`, to
watch the payout gate stop or release it.

**Path parameters** — `mid`: the outlet's MID.

**Body** — strict.

```json
{"sanctions_status": "fail"}
```

**Answers** — `200 {"mid": "…", "sanctions_status": "fail"}`. `400` when
provisioning is unavailable. `502` when B4B refuses (a status other than
`pass`, `review` or `fail` is B4B's `400`, arriving as `502`) or is
unreachable. `404` when the MID is not in the registry; B4B has already
been changed by then.

**Reaches** — `b4b PUT /sim/beneficiaries/{mid}/sanctions` on its control
port.

### `POST /v1/partners`

Add a partner under a distributor.

**Body** — strict.

```json
{"distributor_id": "dst_0001", "name": "Eastgate Partners", "country": "IE"}
```

`name` is required. `distributor_id` may be empty: an existing distributor
is used. No route creates distributors, so there is one, `dst_0001`, unless
the registry file was edited. `country` is not checked: anything but a code
from the countries list is stored as `""`.

**Answers** — `201 {"id": "prt_0010", "distributor_id": "dst_0001", "name": "…", "country": "IE", "created_at": "…"}`;
`400` for a missing name; `404` for an unknown distributor.

**Reaches** — nothing — the lab API's own state.

## Banks

### `GET /v1/banks`

Both banks and their accounts: the business bank (the merchants' own,
where payouts land) and Banking Circle (the safeguarding accounts and a
creditor account per merchant).

**Answers** — `200`, always; a bank that cannot be read has `error` and
no accounts.

```json
{"banks": [{"id": "core-ledger", "name": "Business bank", "kind": "vendor", "service_id": "bank",
            "summary": "…", "number_label": "IBAN", "can_open_account": true,
            "accounts": [{"id": "acc_alice", "number": "GB00SIM0000000000001",
                          "holder": "Alice Simulator", "currency": "EUR", "balance": "10000.00"}, …]},
           {"id": "banking-circle", "name": "Banking Circle", "kind": "vendor",
            "service_id": "banking-circle", "summary": "…", "number_label": "vIBAN",
            "can_open_account": false, "note": "Banking Circle has no account-opening endpoint -- …",
            "accounts": […]}]}
```

The bank ids are `core-ledger` and `banking-circle`; `service_id` is the
catalogue id.

**Reaches** — `GET /sim/accounts` on the bank's and Banking Circle's
control ports (each the same answer as the service's `GET /accounts`).

### `POST /v1/banks/{id}/accounts`

Open an account at the business bank. Banking Circle has no
account-opening endpoint: its accounts appear when first paid into.

**Path parameters** — `id`: `core-ledger`. `banking-circle` answers `501`.

**Body** — strict.

```json
{"holder": "Carol Simulator", "currency": "EUR", "opening_balance": "250.00"}
```

The bank requires `holder` and defaults `currency` to EUR;
`opening_balance` is a decimal string, optional.

**Answers** — `201 {"id": "acc_…", "number": "GB00SIM…", "holder": "Carol Simulator", "currency": "EUR", "balance": "250.00"}`.
`400` for a bad body; `404 unknown bank <id>`; `501` for Banking Circle;
`502` when the bank refuses or is unreachable. A missing `holder` is the
bank's refusal: `502 POST /sim/accounts: HTTP 400: …`.

**Reaches** — `bank POST /sim/accounts` on its control port `{"holder",
"currency", "openingBalance"}`.

### `GET /v1/banking-circle/subscriptions`

Banking Circle's notification subscriptions: where each delivers, for which
events, its status, and how much is waiting.

**Answers** — `200`

```json
{"subscriptions": [{"id": "sub_46bbc839629e",
                    "endpoint": "http://host.containers.internal:3114/api/v1/banking-circle/webhook",
                    "active": true, "status": "active",
                    "status_message": "Subscription successfully created",
                    "version": 1, "max_per_message": 1000, "mtls": false, "email": "…",
                    "events": [{"type": "IncomingPaymentProcessed", "active": true, "targets": 2}, …],
                    "pending": 0, "paused": false, "queued": 0}, …]}
```

- `status` names Banking Circle's number: `inactive` (1), `active` (2),
  `retired` (4), `none` otherwise. `targets` counts the event's target
  accounts; 0 is all.
- `pending` is what Banking Circle kept when it gave up on a dead endpoint
  and deactivated the subscription (it clears on reactivation). `queued` is
  what a pause holds (it clears on resume). When that read fails they stay
  0 and `false`, silently.
- At most 50 subscriptions. `502` when Banking Circle refuses or is
  unreachable.

**Reaches** — `banking-circle GET /sim/subscriptions` (the same answer as
its subscription list), then `GET /sim/subscription/{id}/pending` per
subscription, on its control port.

### `POST /v1/banking-circle/subscriptions/{id}/test`

Fire Banking Circle's own test notification at one subscription, and report
what the endpoint did with it, not only that it was sent.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a subscription id.

**Answers** — `200`, within about three seconds:

```json
{"subscription": "sub_46bbc839629e", "delivered": true,
 "result": "batch of 1 to https://receiver:8443/raw-events — PaymentStatus",
 "detail": {"endpoint": "…", …}}
```

When nothing has landed after three seconds: `{"subscription": "…",
"delivered": false, "result": "queued, but nothing had been delivered
three seconds later — …"}`. `result` and `detail` are the newest entry in
Banking Circle's notifications log, which during a run may be another
delivery. `502` when the test call fails, an unknown id included.

**Reaches** — `banking-circle POST /sim/subscription/{id}/test` (the same
as its `clienttest`), and `GET /sim/activity?limit=1` before it and every
200 ms after, on its control port.

### `POST /v1/banking-circle/subscriptions/{id}/pause`

Stop Banking Circle delivering to one subscription. Notifications queue in
order, and show in its *Notifications sent* log as queued; payments still
process.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a subscription id.

**Answers** — `200`, Banking Circle's body:
`{"subscriptionId": "sub_…", "endpoint": "…", "paused": true, "queued": 0}`.
`502` when Banking Circle refuses (an unknown id included) or is
unreachable.

**Reaches** — `banking-circle POST /sim/subscription/{id}/pause`.

### `POST /v1/banking-circle/subscriptions/{id}/resume`

Release a paused subscription: what it queued goes out oldest first, in
the batches it would have gone out in.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a subscription id.

**Answers** — `200`, Banking Circle's body:
`{"subscriptionId": "sub_…", "endpoint": "…", "paused": false, "released": 2, "queued": 0}`.
`502` as for pause.

**Reaches** — `banking-circle POST /sim/subscription/{id}/resume`.

### `GET /v1/banking-circle/payouts`

Banking Circle's outgoing payments, newest first, with whether each can
still be returned or reversed.

**Answers** — `200`

```json
{"payouts": [{"id": "bcp_f8443acbe8db", "reference": "010F100000000689",
              "external_ref": "sttl_v1:…", "amount": "4394.87", "currency": "EUR",
              "state": "OutgoingPaymentProcessed", "created_at": "2026-11-05T10:02:49Z",
              "can_return": true, "can_reverse": true}, …],
 "total": 1016}
```

At most 20 are listed; `total` counts every outgoing payment. Incoming
payments are left out: a return shows as the payout's `returned_by`.
`can_return` and `can_reverse` are true only for an
`OutgoingPaymentProcessed` payout not already returned. `reference` is
Banking Circle's `paymentReferenceNumber`; `external_ref` is the payout's
`settlementId`. `502` when Banking Circle cannot be read.

**Reaches** — `banking-circle GET /sim/payments` on its control port.

### `POST /v1/banking-circle/payouts/{id}/return`

The beneficiary's bank sends a processed payout back. The payout stays
processed and records `returnedBy`; the money arrives as a new incoming
payment flagged `return`. Cannot be undone.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a payout id (`bcp_…`).

**Answers** — `200`, Banking Circle's body: the new incoming payment.

```json
{"id": "bcp_…", "amount": "4394.87", "currency": "EUR", "return": true,
 "returnOf": "bcp_f8443acbe8db", "returnedReference": "010F100000000689",
 "paymentReferenceNumber": "…", "state": "IncomingPaymentBooked", "createdAt": "…", …}
```

The lab API sends no reason code. `502` when Banking Circle refuses (not
processed, already returned, unknown id) or is unreachable.

**Reaches** — `banking-circle POST /sim/payments/{id}/return` on its
control port.

### `POST /v1/banking-circle/payouts/{id}/reverse`

The scheme undoes a processed payout: it becomes `Reversed`, with a second
booking. Cannot be undone.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a payout id.

**Answers** — `200`, Banking Circle's body: the payout,
`{"id": "bcp_…", "state": "Reversed", "processedAt": "…", "reversedAt": "…", …}`.
`502` as for return.

**Reaches** — `banking-circle POST /sim/payments/{id}/reverse` on its
control port.

### `POST /v1/actions/fund-sga`

Top up the empty safeguarding accounts: the wire Worldline makes on its
morning slot, for a run that did not come through one. An account already
holding money is left alone, so pressing twice is not twice the money.

**Query parameters** — `amount`: the credit per account as a decimal
string, default `1000000.00`; not checked by the lab API.

**Answers** — `200`, per currency (EUR, then GBP), partial success
included:

```json
{"results": [{"currency": "EUR", "account": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000978",
              "before": "0.00", "funded": "1000000.00"},
             {"currency": "GBP", "account": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000826",
              "before": "5321.10", "skipped": "already holds 5321.10"}]}
```

`502 {"error": "EUR: …; GBP: …", "results": […]}` when every currency
failed (no `status` field).

**Reaches** — Banking Circle's control port: `GET
/sim/accounts/{id}/balances` per account, then `POST
/sim/incoming-payments` `{"currency", "amount", "reference"}` for each
empty one (the same money landing as Worldline's wire on the bridge).

## Vendor actions

### `POST /v1/actions/worldline-cycle`

Make Worldline cut and publish its settlement files now rather than at its
slot: one plain file per currency onto its SFTP root and, on the
morning slot only, the matching lump sum wired to the safeguarding
account.

**Query parameters** — `slot`: `morning` (default; also `er`) or
`afternoon` (also `ar`, `confirmation`). `date`: `YYYY-MM-DD`, settle that
day's transactions; without it, the transactions due by Worldline's lab
clock (T+1: yesterday). Both are passed on unescaped.

**Answers** — *verbatim* from Worldline:

```json
{"at": "…", "slot": "ER", "from_date": "2026-11-05", "to_date": "2026-11-05",
 "files": [{"filename": "…", "slot": "ER", "mids": ["…"], "currency": "EUR",
            "amount_cents": 439487, "items": 30, "from_date": "…", "to_date": "…"}, …],
 "lump_sums": [{"currency": "EUR", "amount_cents": 439487, "reference": "…",
                "account_id": "…", "status": "…"}],
 "published": ["…"]}
```

`200`; `207` with `errors` when some files did not publish; `400` for a
bad `slot` or `date`. `502` when Worldline is unreachable or its body is
not JSON.

**Reaches** — `worldline POST /sim/settlement-cycle/run?slot=&date=`.

### `POST /v1/actions/settlement-pull`

Make the settlement stand-in pull Worldline's SFTP now rather than on its
timer. Works while the stand-in is disconnected: that stops only its
timers.

**Answers** — *verbatim* from settlement:

```json
{"pulled": 1,
 "files": [{"name": "…", "slot": "…", "pulled_at": "…", "bytes": 4096, "archived_at": "…",
            "processed": true, "settlement_ids": ["…"], "payouts_by_mid": 6}, …]}
```

`files` is the whole pull history, not only this pull. `502 pull from
<host>:<port> failed: …` from settlement when SFTP fails; `502` from the
lab API when settlement is unreachable.

**Reaches** — `settlement POST /sim/pull` on its control port (the same
as its `POST /worldline/pull`).

## Plugins

### `GET /v1/plugins`

The registered platforms, each as a catalogue entry plus how its
registration stands. Registrations live in memory: after a lab API restart
the list is empty until each plugin renews.

**Answers** — `200`

```json
{"plugins": [{"id": "infinite-local-runner", "name": "Local runner", "kind": "platform",
              "summary": "…", "base_url": "http://host.containers.internal:3109",
              "browse_url": "http://127.0.0.1:3109", "health_path": "/status",
              "activity_path": "/sim/activity", "endpoints": […],
              "plugin": {"clock": "follows", "start_hint": "…", "actions": […],
                         "settlement": {…}, "empty_hints": {…}, "state": "live",
                         "registered_at": "…", "last_seen": "…", "ttl_seconds": 30}}, …]}
```

`state` is `live` (renewed within 30 s), `lapsed` or `stopped`. In
registration order. No health here: `GET /v1/lab` has it.

**Reaches** — nothing — the lab API's own state.

### `POST /v1/plugins`

Register a platform's card, or renew it: the same call every
`renew_seconds`, and a changed descriptor replaces the old one.
[../plugins.md](../plugins.md) is the contract.

**Body** — the descriptor, up to 64 KiB; unknown fields are ignored.

```json
{"id": "my-platform", "name": "My platform", "summary": "…",
 "base_url": "http://host.containers.internal:3109", "browse_url": "http://127.0.0.1:3109",
 "health_path": "/health", "activity_path": "/sim/activity", "clock": "follows",
 "start_hint": "…",
 "actions": [{"id": "sweep", "label": "Run reconciliation sweep", "path": "/sim/sweep", "primary": true}],
 "settlement": {"files_path": "/sim/files", "run_path": "/sim/run", "status_path": "/status",
                "runs_log": "runs"},
 "stand_ins": {"settlement": {"connected": false, "shown": false}}}
```

Refused with `400 bad plugin descriptor: …` unless:

- `id` matches `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,40}$` and is not a lab service's id;
  `name` is set; `clock` is `follows` or `wall`;
- `base_url`, and `browse_url` if set, is an http(s) URL with a host;
- `health_path` is set, and every path is absolute on `base_url` (no
  `//` prefix, `..`, whitespace or backslash);
- there are at most 8 actions, ids unique, each with a label, `method`
  `POST` (the default), `PUT` or `DELETE`, and at most 6 valid `fields`;
- `settlement`, if present, has `files_path` and `run_path`;
- `runs_log` and the `empty_hints` keys are log names, and `stand_ins` names
  only stand-ins.

**Answers** — `200 {"id": "my-platform", "state": "live", "ttl_seconds": 30, "renew_seconds": 10, "clock": "follows"}`.
`400 descriptor: …` for a body that is not JSON.

**Reaches** — nothing before answering. After: the plugin's `health_path`
(an immediate probe) and, when `stand_ins` differs from what was last
applied for this plugin, the stand-in wiring as in
`POST /v1/stand-ins/{id}`.

### `DELETE /v1/plugins/{id}`

Unregister on a clean shutdown. The card stays, grey and `stopped`, showing
`start_hint`; the plugin is no longer probed and its buttons answer `409`.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a plugin id.

**Answers** — `204`; `404 no plugin <id>`.

**Reaches** — nothing — the lab API's own state.

### `POST /v1/plugins/{id}/actions/{action}`

Press one of the plugin's declared buttons: the body goes to the method and
path the plugin declared for it.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a plugin id. `action`: an action id from its
descriptor.

**Body** — anything, forwarded as is (up to 8 KiB), as
`application/json` when not empty. For an action with fields,
`{"<field id>": value, …}`.

**Answers** — *verbatim* from the platform; a non-JSON body arrives as
`{"output": "<text>"}`, an empty one as `{}`. `404` for no such plugin or
`<name> declares no action <action>`; `409 <name> has stopped; start it
again first`; `502` when the platform is unreachable. A lapsed plugin is
still called.

**Reaches** — the plugin's `base_url` + the action's `path`, with the
action's method.

### `GET /v1/plugins/{id}/files`

The settlement files the platform can run: the files table on its card.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a plugin id.

**Answers** — `200`, the platform's body, in the shape
[../plugins.md](../plugins.md#settlement) fixes:

```json
{"dir": "…", "files": [{"name": "…csv", "currency": "EUR", "mids": ["1", "2"],
                        "total": "6660.27", "default": true, "seeded": true,
                        "missing_mids": [], "in_flight": null, "last_run": {…}}, …],
 "seeded_error": null}
```

`404` for no such plugin, or `<name> runs no settlement files`; `409` when
stopped; `502` when the platform is unreachable or answers non-2xx
(`GET <url>: HTTP <code>`, its body dropped).

**Reaches** — the plugin's `base_url` + `settlement.files_path`.

### `POST /v1/plugins/{id}/run`

Start settlement runs on the platform. Several files in one call start
together; one file per currency.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a plugin id.

**Body** — forwarded verbatim (up to 8 KiB).

```json
{"files": ["worldline-reconciliation-sample-gbp.csv"]}
```

**Answers** — *verbatim* from the platform: `202 {"runs": [{"currency": "GBP", "run": "…"}]}`,
or its `409` for a currency already running. `404`, `409` and `502` as for
`GET /v1/plugins/{id}/files`.

**Reaches** — `POST` the plugin's `base_url` + `settlement.run_path`.

### `POST /v1/plugins/{id}/files`

Upload a settlement file from anywhere to the platform, which keeps it and
lists it with its own. The bytes are streamed through; the lab API holds
none of them.

**Path / query parameters** — `id`: a plugin id. `name`: the file's name,
required.

**Body** — the raw file, at most `CONSOLE_UPLOAD_MAX_MB` (512) MB; sent on
as `application/octet-stream`.

**Answers** — *verbatim* from the platform:
`201 {"name": "…", "bytes": 123456, "note": "…"}`, `name` being what it
was kept as. `400 name the file: ?name=<file name>`; `413` over the limit;
`501 <name> does not offer uploads` without `upload_path`; `404`, `409`
and `502` as above. No timeout but the caller's own.

**Reaches** — `POST` the plugin's `base_url` + `settlement.upload_path?name=`.

### `DELETE /v1/plugins/{id}/files`

Delete a file on the platform: any listed file it marks `deletable` when
it declares `delete_path`, otherwise only files uploaded to it.

**Path / query parameters** — `id`: a plugin id. `name`: the file's name
(forwarded as given, even empty).

**Answers** — *verbatim* from the platform: `204`; `403` with its reason
for a file it will not delete; `404` for a name it does not list. `501`
when it declares neither `delete_path` nor `upload_path`; `404`, `409` and
`502` as above.

**Reaches** — `DELETE` the plugin's `base_url` + `settlement.delete_path?name=`,
or `settlement.upload_path?name=` without one.

### `GET /v1/plugins/{id}/files/preview`

The first lines of one settlement file, read no further however long it
is.

**Path / query parameters** — `id`: a plugin id. `name`: the file's name.
`lines`: 1 to 1000, default 100; above 1000 is 1000, anything else 100.

**Answers** — *verbatim* from the platform:
`200 {"name": "…", "lines": ["…", …], "truncated": true, "long_lines": 0, "bytes": 123456}`.
`501` without `preview_path`; `404`, `409` and `502` as above.

**Reaches** — `GET` the plugin's `base_url` + `settlement.preview_path?name=&lines=`.

### `POST /v1/plugins/{id}/files/reveal`

Open the folder a file is in, in the file manager of the machine the
platform runs on. Only the platform can: the lab API may be in a
container, and a web page may not open a local folder.

**Path parameters** — `id`: a plugin id.

**Body** — forwarded verbatim (up to 8 KiB).

```json
{"name": "worldline-reconciliation-sample-gbp.csv"}
```

**Answers** — *verbatim* from the platform:
`200 {"path": "…", "dir": "…", "note": "…"}`, or `409` with the path when
that machine has no desktop. `501` without `reveal_path`; `404`, `409` and
`502` as above.

**Reaches** — `POST` the plugin's `base_url` + `settlement.reveal_path`.

## Connect

### `GET /v1/connect`

What each vendor asks of a platform that connects to it: the variables it
sets, and the key files on offer and whether they exist yet. Names only, no
values: those are in the `.env` and file downloads.

**Query parameters** — `host`: the hostname or IP the platform reaches the
lab at (letters, digits, `.`, `:` and `-`). Default: the host this request
came in on, or `127.0.0.1`.

**Answers** — `200`

```json
{"host": "127.0.0.1",
 "kits": [{"service": "worldline", "title": "Worldline", "note": "…",
           "vars": [{"key": "WORLDLINE_SFTP_HOST"},
                    {"key": "WORLDLINE_SFTP_HOST_KEY_FINGERPRINT", "note": "…"},
                    {"key": "INFINITE_PGP_PRIVATE_KEY", "note": "…",
                     "missing": "keys/wlsftp-keys/worldline_private.asc is not there yet — …"}, …],
           "files": [{"name": "worldline-pgp-public.asc", "purpose": "…", "present": true}, …]},
          …]}
```

Kits, in order: `worldline`, `b4b`, `banking-circle`, `aci`,
`verification`, `verify`. A var with `"optional": true` is written
commented out in the `.env`. `400 host must be a hostname or an IP
address`.

**Reaches** — nothing — the lab API's own state and the keys directory
(`CONSOLE_KEYS_DIR`).

### `GET /v1/connect/env`

Download `fintechlab.env`: every vendor's variables with their values, for
a platform's `.env`.

**Query parameters** — `host`: as for `GET /v1/connect`.

**Answers** — `200`, `text/plain`, `Content-Disposition: attachment;
filename="fintechlab.env"`, `Cache-Control: no-store`:

```
# fintech sim lab v1 — connection settings for a platform under test
# Downloaded from the lab API 2026-11-07T12:00:00Z, for a lab reached at 127.0.0.1.
…
# ── Worldline ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
…
WORLDLINE_SFTP_HOST=127.0.0.1
WORLDLINE_SFTP_PORT=2222
…
# NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=./fintechlab-ca.pem
```

Keys and certificates are read from the keys directory at request time;
addresses, account ids and credentials are what compose.yml ships.
Multi-line values are double-quoted. A key not generated yet is a comment
on its variable, never a value. `400` (JSON) for a bad `host`.

**Reaches** — nothing — the lab API's own state and the keys directory.

### `GET /v1/connect/env/{service}`

Download one vendor's part of `fintechlab.env`, as
`fintechlab-<service>.env`.

**Path / query parameters** — `service`: `worldline`, `b4b`,
`banking-circle`, `aci`, `verification` or `verify`. `host`: as for
`GET /v1/connect`.

**Answers** — `200` as for `GET /v1/connect/env`. `404 <service> has
nothing a platform needs to connect`; `400` for a bad `host`.

**Reaches** — nothing — the lab API's own state and the keys directory.

### `GET /v1/connect/files/{service}/{name}`

Download one key or certificate file, the one the lab is running with now.
Only client-side material is offered.

**Path parameters**

| `service` | `name` |
| --- | --- |
| `worldline` | `worldline-pgp-public.asc`, `worldline-pgp-private.asc`, `worldline-sftp-host-key.pub` |
| `b4b` | `b4b-jwt-private.pem`, `b4b-jwt-public.pem` |
| `banking-circle` | `fintechlab-ca.pem`, `bc-client.pem`, `bc-client-key.pem` |

**Answers** — `200`, `application/octet-stream`, `Content-Disposition:
attachment; filename="<name>"`, `Cache-Control: no-store`. `404 <service>
has no keys to hand out` for a service with no kit; `404 no such file in
this kit: …` for a name its kit does not offer (every name, for `aci`,
`verification` and `verify`); `503 <name> is not available: …` when the
file is not generated yet or the keys directory is not mounted.

**Reaches** — nothing — the keys directory.
