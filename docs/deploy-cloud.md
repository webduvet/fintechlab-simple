# Running the lab in the cloud

[deploy-pod.md](deploy-pod.md) runs the lab as one podman pod from images.
This is the same pod on a machine somewhere else, for a platform that is
*deployed* rather than run from a laptop: an environment of your own that
switches its vendor endpoints to the lab by configuration.

## Two profiles, one set of images

The images are the ones `make pod-images` builds, unchanged. What differs is
the manifest, and only in a few values, so there is no second manifest:
`deploy/pod/render` derives the deployment's from the checked-in
`deploy/pod/fintechlab.yaml`, and its tests fail if a rendering changes
anything it was not asked to.

| | local (`make up`, `make pod-up`) | cloud (`make cloud-bundle`, `lab.sh deploy`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lab clock | the `clock` container; every vendor follows it | none: every vendor is on the real time |
| `/v1/clock` | the clock; the console's card, controls, *Move it* | `{"absent": true}` and the real time; a move or a hold is a `501` (`CONSOLE_URL_CLOCK=off` on the lab API) |
| Lab API token | none unless you set `LAB_API_TOKEN` | always: made on the host at the first deploy, kept with the lab's state |
| `.env` downloads | addressed to the host the request came in on | addressed to the lab's public host (`CONSOLE_CONNECT_HOST`), even through a tunnel |
| Certificates | `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, the lab names | the same, plus the public host (`CERT_EXTRA_SANS`) |
| Webhook allowlists | lab names, `host.containers.internal` | the same, plus the platform's hosts (`LAB_WEBHOOK_ALLOW`) |

**Why no clock.** Moving time works when the lab and the platform share a
clock: a local runner follows the lab's offset through its clock shim. A
deployed platform runs on its own wall clock and cannot be moved, so a lab
it talks to must not move either — a payout booked "on Monday" by the
platform has to book on Monday at the bank. Without `LAB_CLOCK_URL` each
vendor dates what it does by its own wall clock, which is what the code has
always done with no clock to follow; nothing is compiled differently. The
lab API's other controls — Worldline cycles, funding, returns and reversals,
traps, pausing Banking Circle's delivery, a reset — work as they do locally.

**Why a token.** Locally the lab API is open, as a laptop's lab usually is.
A lab reached over a network asks every caller of `:8097` for its token
(`LAB_API_TOKEN`, [deploy-pod.md](deploy-pod.md#asking-for-a-token)).
`deploy/host/play.sh` makes one on the first deploy and keeps it on the data
volume, so a redeploy, a stop or a replaced host keeps it; `lab.sh token`
prints it. The console adds it to every call it forwards that brings no
token of its own, so its page needs none — which is also why the console
itself is kept behind the allowlist ([Reaching it](#reaching-it)).

`make cloud-manifest` prints the rendered manifest; `LAB_PROFILE=local`
keeps the clock, for a lab on another machine that a laptop runner follows.

## The AWS stack

`deploy/aws/fintechlab.yaml` is one CloudFormation template; `deploy/aws/lab.sh`
drives it with nothing but the AWS CLI (no CDK bootstrap, no state backend).

| Resource | Why |
| --- | --- |
| VPC, one public subnet, internet gateway | the lab's own network: nothing in it depends on, peers with, or blocks deleting anyone else's |
| Allowlist and security group | three rules — the vendors' own surfaces and the console (8080-8090), the lab API (8097), SFTP (2222) — open to the addresses on a managed prefix list, the [allowlist](#who-may-reach-it-the-allowlist); optionally a fourth, 8080-8090 only, open to a second list, the console list. Never `:8095` (Banking Circle's bridge, no auth), a control port (a vendor's port plus 1000) or the receiver stand-in's 8443: from outside, the lab API is the one way to steer the lab. An empty list opens nothing |
| HTTPS console (with `LAB_DOMAIN`) | a second security group: 443 for both lists, 80 for anyone. The pod's front — Caddy, unchanged, its config in the rendered manifest — gets a Let's Encrypt certificate for the name over 80, renews it, redirects the rest of 80 to https and forwards 443 to the console. Its certificates live on the `fintechlab-front-data` volume, so a deploy does not ask for them again. See [The console on https](#the-console-on-https) |
| EC2 host, Ubuntu 24.04, `t3.small` | SSM only: no key pair, no port 22. IMDSv2 with hop limit 1, so no container can act as the host's role, which can only be managed by SSM anyway |
| Data volume (20 GiB) | podman's storage. A replaced host — a new image, a new type — keeps every key the platform holds |
| Elastic IP | the lab's one stable address; optionally a Route 53 record for `LAB_DOMAIN` |
| Private bucket | how a bundle reaches the host: `lab.sh` uploads it and hands the host a presigned URL, so the host's role has no S3 access |

There is no user data. `deploy/host/play.sh` prepares the host on the first
deploy (data volume, podman, start on boot) and is a no-op after that, so
editing it never replaces the instance. The host image is resolved once, when
the stack is created, and kept: a new Ubuntu image never replaces the lab
host on its own (`LAB_REFRESH_IMAGE=1 lab.sh infra` takes one on purpose).

### Who may reach it: the allowlist

The security group's rules name a managed prefix list (`<stack>-allowed`,
the stack's `AllowListId` output), not addresses. The template creates the
list and never sets its entries, so the addresses on it are people's to
change, and changing them is not drift: CloudFormation checks only the
properties a template sets.

```sh
deploy/aws/lab.sh allow                       # your address, as https://checkip.amazonaws.com sees it
deploy/aws/lab.sh allow 203.0.113.7 "QA laptop"   # someone else's, with a note
deploy/aws/lab.sh allow --console 203.0.113.9 "Sam home office"   # the console list
deploy/aws/lab.sh deny 203.0.113.7/32         # off whichever list holds it
deploy/aws/lab.sh allowed                     # every entry: who added it, when, why
```

An entry records who added it and when, so the next person reading the list
can tell what may go. In effect within seconds; nothing is redeployed. The
VPC console does the same (*Managed prefix lists* → the list → *Modify*).

- **Two lists, when there are many people.** The allowlist opens every
  rule: the platform's NAT addresses go there, since they need SFTP and the
  lab API. The **console list** (`<stack>-console`, the `ConsoleListId`
  output) opens the console and the vendors' pages only — the people who
  look at the lab. They still reach the lab API, through the console, which
  forwards `/v1` and adds the admin token to a call that brings none:
  `https://<LAB_DOMAIN>/v1` or `http://<PublicHost>:8090/v1`. A script or
  agent that sends its environment's token there is forwarded with it, and
  held to that environment as on `:8097`. Its people get no SFTP. Moving an address from the console list to the
  allowlist is `lab.sh allow` on it.
- **How many.** Each rule that names a list costs the list's size against
  the security group's rules — 60, the VPC quota *Inbound or outbound rules
  per security group* — so `3 × LAB_ALLOWLIST_SIZE + LAB_CONSOLE_LIST_SIZE`
  must fit. The default is an allowlist of 20 and no console list; a lab
  with a team on it might keep 6 and 42. `lab.sh infra` checks the sum
  against the account's quota and refuses a size below what a list holds.
  Shrinking the allowlist while growing the console list is one update;
  the other way round is two (shrink the console list first).
- **Who may edit them.** Anyone whose role can call
  `ec2:ModifyManagedPrefixList` on them — an account administrator, or a
  role given the stack's `AllowListEditorsPolicyArn` output: a policy for
  these lists and nothing else.
- **Nothing broader than /16.** `lab.sh` refuses it: the console asks for
  no login, so the lists are all that keep it private.
- **`LAB_ALLOWED_CIDRS`** in `lab.env` seeds the allowlist at `lab.sh
  infra`: missing entries are added, nothing is ever removed. `infra` also
  puts back any entry an update of the stack might drop, on either list.

### Sharing an account

The stack is built to sit in an account that holds other workloads:

- **It references nothing.** No imported values, no other stack's outputs,
  no shared bucket, VPC, zone or role. Deleting it, or anything else, never
  waits on the other.
- **It names nothing.** Every physical name is CloudFormation's, prefixed
  with the stack's, so it cannot collide with a name another tool chose.
- **It changes nothing account-wide.** No CDK bootstrap, no account
  settings, no service-linked configuration.
- **It is tagged** `Project=fintechlab`, `ManagedBy=fintechlab-simple`.
- **`LAB_ACCOUNT_ID`** makes `lab.sh` refuse any other account, so a shell
  pointed at the wrong profile fails before it changes anything.

What it does share is the region's quotas: one VPC and one Elastic IP
(the defaults are five of each).

## First deploy

```sh
cp deploy/aws/lab.env.example deploy/aws/lab.env   # then fill it in
make aws-infra     # the stack: a few minutes
make aws-deploy    # build, upload, play; a new host installs podman first
make aws-e2e       # the e2e suite, inside the pod: is the lab connected?
make aws-env       # the platform's .env, addressed to the lab
make aws-token     # the lab API's token
```

`lab.env` holds the account, the stack's name, who may reach the lab and
the platform's webhook hosts — each variable is described in
[lab.env.example](../deploy/aws/lab.env.example). Everything set in the
environment wins over the file. A second lab, in another account or under
another stack name, is a second file: `LAB_CONFIG=deploy/aws/lab-sbx.env
deploy/aws/lab.sh deploy` (`lab-*.env` is gitignored too).

`aws-deploy` builds `dist/fintechlab-cloud.tgz` (the images, the e2e
suite's, the rendered manifest, `play.sh`, `e2e.sh`), uploads it, and runs
`play.sh` on the host over SSM, printing what it printed. The pod is up when
it says so: the lab API and the console answer by then, and the lab API has
refused a call without its token.

`aws-e2e` is the check that the deploy is a lab and not a set of
containers: it runs `cmd/e2e` on the host, inside the pod, playing the
platform on every vendor's surface and steering the lab through the lab
API with its token. Inside, because the suite registers callbacks the lab
must reach (B4B's, on the settlement stand-in) — the same reason
`make e2e-docker` joins the compose network. `E2E_ONLY=…` narrows it.

## Reaching it

**The console asks for nothing.** It adds the lab API's admin token to
what it forwards without a token, so whoever reaches `:8090` — or the
console on https — can drive the lab as its admin, in any environment, download its keys
and register a plugin. The lab API on `:8097` asks for the token. Every key
is fake, but never open either to `0.0.0.0/0`. Three ways in, from least to
most exposed:

1. **SSM port forwarding** — `make aws-console` puts it on
   `http://127.0.0.1:8090` for as long as the command runs. Needs the
   [Session Manager plugin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html)
   and nothing else: it works with nobody on the allowlist.
2. **An address on the allowlist** — `deploy/aws/lab.sh allow` adds yours,
   and the console is `http://<PublicHost>:8090`.
3. **A name** — `LAB_DOMAIN` (with `LAB_HOSTED_ZONE_ID` the stack writes
   the record). The link is `https://<LAB_DOMAIN>`
   ([below](#the-console-on-https)), and `http://<LAB_DOMAIN>:8090` still
   works; the certificates the platform dials carry the name. Set it before
   the first deploy, or redeploy with new keys.

### The console on https

A lab with a name serves its console at `https://<LAB_DOMAIN>`, for the
same people as `:8090`: both lists. `lab.sh infra` gives the host a second
security group — 443 for the lists, 80 for anyone — and `lab.sh deploy`
adds a front to the pod: Caddy, from its own image, with a Caddyfile the
renderer writes (`deploy/pod/render.go`). It

- gets a certificate for the name from Let's Encrypt and renews it, by the
  HTTP challenge on 80 — which is why 80 is open to the internet. Nothing
  else answers there: every other request on 80 is a redirect to https.
  The TLS challenge is off, since 443 is not open to Let's Encrypt;
- forwards everything on 443 to the console on `:8090`, so `/v1` is the lab
  API there too: the admin token added to a call that brings none, a
  caller's own token kept;
- keeps its account and certificates on the `fintechlab-front-data`
  volume, so a deploy does not ask for them again (Let's Encrypt allows five
  of the same certificate a week).

The name must point at the lab before the deploy: Let's Encrypt checks it
from outside. `lab.sh deploy` checks `https://<LAB_DOMAIN>` at the end;
`lab.sh logs front` shows how a certificate is going. The vendors' ports
stay direct: Banking Circle's mTLS ends at the lab, and SFTP is not HTTP.

A link that anyone in the company can open, behind the company's sign-in,
is still a load balancer with an OIDC action in front of `:8090`; this one
is for the people on the lists.

## Connecting a platform

**Give a deployed platform an environment of its own** when the lab serves
anything else too: a runner on someone's laptop, an e2e run, a second
stack ([lab-api/environments.md](lab-api/environments.md)). Create it once,
with the admin token:

```sh
T=$(deploy/aws/lab.sh token)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $T" http://<PublicHost>:8097/v1/environments \
  -d '{"name": "sbx", "config": {"settlement_identifier": "Infinite_Payment",
       "webhook_hosts": ["<the platform's callback ALB hosts>"]}}'
curl -OJ -H "Authorization: Bearer $T" "http://<PublicHost>:8097/v1/connect/env?env=sbx"
```

`fintechlab-sbx.env` is that platform's kit: its own Banking Circle login
and safeguarding account ids, its own B4B signing key, its own SFTP user,
and its own lab token (`FINTECH_SIM_LAB_TOKEN`), which reaches only its
data. Its settlement identifier and callback hosts are its environment's
config, not `LAB_SET` or `LAB_WEBHOOK_ALLOW`, which stay for the default
environment. The console's *Environments* view does the same, and its
selector shows each one's payouts, files and activity apart. A platform on
the default environment needs none of this, and everything below still
applies to it.

- **Addresses and keys.** `make aws-env` (or *Configuration → Connect your
  platform*) downloads one `.env` with every vendor's address, lab
  credentials and keys, addressed to the lab's public host. The certificates
  name that host, so Banking Circle's mTLS verifies against the lab CA in the
  file. From where the console is not reachable, `aws-env` fetches the same
  file over SSM.
- **The lab's address and token.** A platform that registers its card,
  follows the lab or calls its hooks does it on the lab API:
  `FINTECH_SIM_LAB_URL=http://<PublicHost>:8097` (the stack's `LabApiUrl`
  output) and `FINTECH_SIM_LAB_TOKEN` from `make aws-token`
  ([plugins.md](plugins.md#reaching-the-platform)).
- **Its outbound addresses.** The platform reaches the lab from its NAT
  gateways' Elastic IPs: `deploy/aws/lab.sh allow <ip> "platform NAT"` for each.
- **Its inbound endpoints.** Banking Circle's webhooks and B4B's callbacks
  go to URLs the platform registers; their hosts go in `LAB_WEBHOOK_ALLOW`.
  A target the lab dials from its own configuration (ACI's webhook) is a
  `LAB_SET` override, e.g.
  `LAB_SET="aci.ACI_WEBHOOK_TARGET_URL=https://hooks.example.com/aci"`.
  Outbound, the lab trusts the public CAs as well as its own
  ([security/ca-and-tls.md](security/ca-and-tls.md)). Then `make aws-deploy`.
- **Its card, if it wants one.** An environment turns green in the console
  once a vendor has seen its platform log in, with no card at all. A
  platform that brings buttons registers at `/v1/plugins` with
  `"clock": "wall"` ([plugins.md](plugins.md)), with its environment's
  token. The card's live parts need the lab API to reach the platform's
  `base_url`, which has to be a public address of the platform's.
- **Banking Circle remembers.** Its balances, payouts, subscriptions,
  notifications not yet delivered and bearer tokens are in its state file,
  on the data volume (`fintechlab-bc-data`): after a redeploy or a stop the
  platform's safeguarding balance, subscription and token are still there,
  and a payout caught mid-run finishes. So do the environments: they are in
  the lab API's database, on the data volume, and every vendor gets its
  customers again within seconds of starting.

## A runner on your machine

The cloud profile is for a deployed platform. A platform run from a laptop
— a local runner that follows the lab's clock — can drive the cloud lab
too, as it drives a local one:

1. **The lab, with its clock.** `LAB_PROFILE=local` in `lab.env`, then
   `make aws-deploy`. Moving time works again; set it back to the cloud
   profile (and redeploy) before a deployed platform points at the lab.
2. **Its callbacks.** The lab calls the platform back — Banking Circle's
   webhooks, B4B's callbacks, the plugin card's buttons — and a laptop has
   no address the lab can reach. `deploy/aws/lab.sh tunnel 3000 3114 3109`
   (the platform's ports; leave it running) makes each one
   `host.containers.internal:<port+10000>` inside the lab, over SSH within
   an SSM session: no port opened, no third party. Those are the addresses
   the platform registers, and the lab's webhook allowlists already accept
   that host.
3. **Its configuration.** Every vendor address becomes the lab's public
   host; the keys come from the lab's *Connect your platform* files (the
   `.env` from `make aws-env`, or `/v1/connect/files/…` into a keys
   directory laid out like `keys/`); the lab itself is
   `FINTECH_SIM_LAB_URL=http://<PublicHost>:8097` with the token from
   `make aws-token`. Nothing reaches Banking Circle's bridge (`:8095`): the
   platform asks its own Banking Circle app, as it does deployed.

The platform's own callback addresses become
`http://host.containers.internal:<port+10000>/…`; its card's `base_url`
the same for its control port.

**A callback through the tunnel arrives from loopback.** ssh hands it to
`localhost`, so a platform that checks where a callback comes from (an IP
allowlist on B4B's callback, say) sees `::1` or `127.0.0.1`, not the lab's
address, and has to allow those for as long as it runs on the tunnel.

## Day to day

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `make aws-deploy` | a new build onto the same host. The keys survive |
| `REGENERATE_KEYS=true deploy/aws/lab.sh deploy` | new PKI and keypairs; every copy the platform holds stops working |
| `ROTATE_TOKEN=true deploy/aws/lab.sh deploy` | a new lab API token; every caller holding the old one is refused |
| `make aws-e2e` | the e2e suite inside the pod; `E2E_ONLY=a,b deploy/aws/lab.sh e2e` for some |
| `make aws-token` | the lab API's token |
| `deploy/aws/lab.sh tunnel <port>…` | this machine's ports, reachable from the lab as `host.containers.internal:<port+10000>`, until Ctrl-C |
| `deploy/aws/lab.sh logs front` | the HTTPS front's log: its certificate, renewals, what it forwarded |
| `make aws-allow` / `make aws-allowed` | add your address to the allowlist / list both lists; `deploy/aws/lab.sh allow --console <ip> <note>` adds to the console list, `deploy/aws/lab.sh deny <cidr>` takes one off |
| `make aws-status` | the stack's outputs, the host, the revision it runs, each container |
| `deploy/aws/lab.sh logs banking-circle` | the last 200 lines (`LAB_TAIL`) of one container |
| `make aws-shell` | a shell on the host: `sudo podman ps --pod` |
| `make aws-stop` / `make aws-start` | a stopped host costs only its disks and address; the pod comes back on start |
| `make aws-destroy` | everything, after you type the stack's name |

**What persists:** the data volume holds podman's storage — the six named
volumes ([deploy-pod.md](deploy-pod.md#what-persists)), Banking Circle's
and B4B's state among them, and the images — and the lab API's token. It
survives a redeploy, a stop and a replaced host; it goes with
`aws-destroy`. **What does not:** what the other vendors keep only in
memory, as locally.

**Several labs** are several stacks: `LAB_STACK=fintechlab-qa lab.sh infra`.
The pod is single-host by design — its containers find each other on the
pod's loopback — so a lab is one host.

**Rough cost** (eu-west-1, on-demand): the host about $15 a month, the
address $3.60, the disks $3. Stopped, only the last two.

## Without AWS

Nothing in the bundle knows it is on AWS. On any Linux host with `apt` or
`dnf` and systemd:

```sh
make cloud-bundle LAB_PUBLIC_HOST=lab.example.com LAB_WEBHOOK_ALLOW=hooks.example.com
scp dist/fintechlab-cloud.tgz host:
ssh host 'mkdir -p lab && tar -xzf fintechlab-cloud.tgz -C lab && sudo sh lab/play.sh'
```

`play.sh` installs podman if it is missing, loads the images, plays the
pod with a lab API token (`/var/lib/fintechlab/lab-api-token`) and has it
start on boot; `sudo sh lab/e2e.sh` runs the e2e suite inside it. A host
whose podman cannot make a bridge plays with `POD_NETWORK=slirp4netns`
([deploy-pod.md](deploy-pod.md#the-podman-quirks)). Open the lab's ports —
8080-8090, 8097, 2222 — to whoever needs them with that host's own
firewall, and never a control port.
