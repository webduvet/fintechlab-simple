# Catalogue

## Which half is which

This repo simulates **the third parties**, so a platform can be developed
and tested against them locally. It is not the platform.

That distinction was previously not written down anywhere, and the code had
drifted across it — the platform side was generating the settlement file it
was supposed to be *receiving*. Everything below is labelled, and the rule
is: **a vendor simulation is the deliverable; scaffolding exists only so
the e2e suite can prove each vendor hop is really connected.**

Every simulated service is one of two kinds, and `GET /sim/info` says
which (`kind`):

- **vendor** — a third party's service, simulated: something the platform
  will talk to in production and that someone else runs (Worldline, B4B,
  Banking Circle, ACI, the verification vendors, the merchants' bank).
- **stand-in** — a service the platform team would provide itself, simulated
  because a test does not need the real one or it does not exist yet (the
  settlement path, the webhook listener, the verification-service, the
  demo payment API and notifier).

The rest is the lab itself (`lab`: the clock, the lab API, the console),
not a simulation of anything.

| Service | Side | Swap for the real thing by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **worldline** | vendor | pointing `WORLDLINE_SFTP_HOST` and the credentials at real Worldline |
| **b4b** | vendor | pointing `B4B_URL` at the real Oversight API |
| **banking-circle** | vendor | pointing at the real Connect API |
| **aci** | vendor | — it is a *sender*; point `ACI_WEBHOOK_TARGET_URL` at your listener |
| **settlement** | stand-in | replacing it with your own platform |
| **receiver** | stand-in | pointing the vendors' webhook URLs at your own listener |
| **bank** (*business bank*) | vendor (the far end) | — the merchants' own bank: Banking Circle credits each processed payout here. Nothing to swap; a platform never calls it |
| **payment-api**, **notifier** | stand-in (demo) | — generic shapes, not vendor-specific; only `make demo-payment` and the e2e suite call them |
| **creditsafe**, **kyc6**, **lexisnexis**, **iban-com** | vendor | real KYC/AML vendors, one sim each (`internal/vendorsim` holds what they share) |
| **verify** | stand-in | your own verification-service: pointing the platform's verification-service URL at it replaces that service |
| **clock** | lab | nothing — the lab's business clock; vendors and a registered platform follow it ([plugins.md](plugins.md#the-clock)) |
| *a registered platform* | platform (plugin) | nothing — it *is* the platform; it registers its own card ([plugins.md](plugins.md)) |
| **ca** | supporting | a real PKI |
| **lab-api** | lab | nothing — the one API over the lab (`/v1`), a client of the others; see [api/lab-api.md](api/lab-api.md) |
| **console** | control panel | — a page that calls the lab API; see [console.md](console.md) |

The scaffolding is deliberately kept, and deliberately not grown. It is
what makes `make e2e` able to fail loudly when a hop is disconnected,
and it is a worked example of the consumer side — but it is a stand-in for
your platform, not a model of it.

| Service | What it fakes | What's stubbed | Still vendor-shaped |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **ca** | Private CA + server certs (SAN `receiver`, `banking-circle`, `localhost`, plus `.test` demo domains — see `docs/local-domains.md`) + client cert | No CRL/OCSP, no HSM | Same *job* as a corporate PKI issuing mTLS material |
| **bank** *(business bank)* | The beneficiary's bank: takes each payout Banking Circle passes on (`POST /internal/credit`, by IBAN or account number + sort code) and opens the outlet's account on first sight; also a ledger with balances and transfers for `make demo-payment`. Logs *Payouts credited* and *Accounts and transfers* at `/sim/activity` | No rails, no FX, no reserved funds, memory only | The money's last hop, observable — and the internal core-ledger call a payment API would make |
| **payment-api** | `POST /payments` + `Idempotency-Key`, `GET /payments/{id}` | No authN/Z, no cut-off, no batch files | Generic payment facade (not B4B-shaped — see B4B below) |
| **notifier** | Signed webhook POST, retries, allowlist, failed subscription | No signed-cert pinning, no multi-tenant routing | PSP webhook worker |
| **receiver** *(scaffolding)* | HTTPS endpoint that verifies HMAC and stores events, plus a raw unvalidated capture sink (`/raw-events`) for wire formats it holds no key for (Banking Circle's AES-GCM, ACI's). Bodies are retained (bounded, base64) so a holder of the key can decrypt a capture and assert on what was delivered | No replay store beyond one process, no business handler, no keys of its own | Stand-in for your own webhook listener |
| **settlement** *(scaffolding)* | The platform side, as a stand-in: pulls Worldline's settlement file over real SFTP, parses it, splits it per MID, and pays each outlet out through B4B — gated on the safeguarding-account balance and a merchant-verification check. Also its own internal reports and reconciliation API | No real clearing, no fee schedules, no FX. Not a model of any real platform | The consumer half of the causal chain, exercised over the wire rather than through a shared directory |
| **worldline** | The acquirer: holds the card transactions it acquired per submerchant (MID), cuts the daily Bambora settlement file from them in two slots (morning `ER` + afternoon `AR` confirmation), publishes them plain, as Worldline does, over a real SSH/SFTP server (:2222), wires the matching lump sum to the safeguarding account, and serves the SFT file-exchange channel over HTTP (:8084) | No Acquiring REST API (SFTP is the whole integration today). No chargebacks — the `CB` section is emitted and always empty, because there is no dispute source to invent one from | Real Bambora multi-section file format, the real filename pattern and its two delivery slots, real SFTP+PGP transport with key or password auth and host-key pinning |
| **banking-circle** | Basic→Bearer auth behind optional mTLS (`BC_MTLS`), a safeguarding-account ledger credited by the acquirer's lump sum, per-merchant auto-vivified creditor accounts, the full notification self-service API (subscriptions with `rowVersion`/`If-Match`, per-subscription encryption keys, `maxNotificationsPerMessage`, events with Account/Company/CompanyGroup targets), **batched** AES-256-GCM notifications routed by subscribed event and target, and the documented eleven-step retry schedule ending in auto-deactivation, retained notifications and redelivery on reactivation. The reconciliation reads: the intraday reconciliation report (paged, six required parameters, `PropertiesIncluded`/`PropertiesExcluded`), the rejection report, and the single-payment status. Bookings are dated on the bank's business day (CET, 19:00 cutoff, weekends to Monday) on the platform's clock. Lab-only hooks to reverse or return a processed payout, force the next payouts to reject or hang, and pause a subscription's delivery. All of it — balances, payouts, subscriptions, notifications not yet delivered, bearer tokens — persisted to `bc-data/state.json`, with an interrupted payout and its notifications resuming after a restart | No real credential store (any Basic auth succeeds), no FX, no bulk payments, no bank holidays, no direct debits | Banking Circle's auth/balance/notification/SGA contract, its subscription DTO and concurrency rules, its retry schedule, its exact webhook cipher and per-event payload shapes (from its payload examples), and its report and status contracts including the 400 body (no payment-creation endpoint — real Banking Circle has none) |
| **b4b** | B4B Payments: JWT(RS512)-authed Oversight API, both halves. **Boarding** — companies (422 on a repeated `external_ref`), addresses, people (natural and legal, screened on a callback carrying sanctions *and* PEP status separately), document uploads, the create-once extended profile, vIBANs. **Payout** — beneficiary registration with `pass`/`review`/`fail` sanctions and active/disabled status on a status-change callback, four 422 gates (sanctions, disabled, creditor-consistency, optionally paying company, all forwarding nothing), payout lifecycle (`B4BAccepted`→…→`B4BTMApproved`/`B4BFailed`) with a callback on every regulatory-phase change, `GET /payments/{id}` for a missed callback, and the bridge into Banking Circle once approved. All of it persisted to `b4b-data/state.json`, with an interrupted payment resuming after a restart | No real sanctions/PEP/KYB screening — everything boarded passes, on a delay, with lab-only `PUT /sim/...` endpoints to move any status and a configured force-fail list for payments. Documents are accepted, measured and **discarded**, never stored and never judged. No batch payments | B4B Oversight API shape end to end (byte-exact wire types: JSON-number amounts, `country` refs, `chargeBearer` `SHA`/`BEN`/`OUR`), the boarding rules a client actually trips over, its gates and its callback semantics — this lab's only real inbound-payment caller of Banking Circle |
| **aci** | Online card-payment gateway: AES-256-GCM encrypted webhook notification (hex IV/tag/body, distinct key encoding from Banking Circle's), simulating "a card payment just happened" | No merchant-onboarding REST client, no SFTP+PGP file-exchange channel (both real but separate ACI surfaces, out of scope) | ACI's real webhook crypto envelope and notification payload shape (known-answer-tested against ACI's own published reference vector) |
| **verify** | Merchant verification / compliance-check service gating a payout: always-approves by default, `x-internal-api-key` shared-secret auth | No real AML/sanctions/KYC vendor calls (explicitly a sample/stub, per product decision) | verification-service's real trigger-then-read-decision contract and decision-enum values |
| **lab-api** *(lab)* | Nothing. It holds no vendor contract at all: it reads and drives the services above on their control ports, passes their `/sim/*` hooks through with no vendor credentials, and owns only the lab's own state (the merchant registry, `console-data/registry.json`, and the plugin registrations) | Not a dependency of any service, and no vendor traffic goes through it. The console page, agents and the e2e suite steer the lab through it | — an API, not a simulation |
| **console** *(control panel)* | Nothing: a page, served with a forward of `/v1` to the lab API. No state, no credentials | Not a dependency of anything | — a UI, not a simulation |

Nothing in this table is a real clearing system.

## Kernels and pods

The table above is the *standalone services*. There is now a second,
composable architecture beside them — brand-generic kernels composed into
exactly what has and has not moved.

## Code structure

Which side of the vendor/platform line a service is on (above) is a
different question from how its Go code is organized on disk — see
[docs/structure/](structure/README.md) for the cmd/+internal split, what
`internal/` actually restricts, and a file-by-file walkthrough of three
services.

| Document | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Code structure overview](structure/README.md) | One module, eleven binaries: the cmd/+internal split, what `internal/` actually restricts, compile-time graph vs runtime graph |
| [banking-circle](structure/banking-circle.md) | File-by-file: ledger, payment engine, subscriptions, dispatcher, delivery/retry, reconciliation |
| [b4b](structure/b4b.md) | File-by-file: RS512 JWT auth, the boarding chain, beneficiary gates, payout lifecycle, the Banking Circle bridge |
| [worldline](structure/worldline.md) | File-by-file: split across `cmd/worldline` (acquirer) and `cmd/settlement` (consumer), the Bambora file format, the real SFTP+PGP transport |

## End-to-end tests

`cmd/e2e` runs black-box scenarios against the whole chain above:
generic payment-api → ledger → webhook; a Worldline settlement batch
staging both the WX report and the real Bambora file, retrieved through
both the HTTP view and the real SFTP channel (SSH auth and file transfer
genuinely exercised); the real payout rail — settlement
(gated on Banking Circle's safeguarding-account balance, simulating
Worldline's lump sum landing and retrying when the gate first blocks it)
→ B4B (JWT-signed) → B4B's own lifecycle → Banking Circle (mTLS + bearer,
AES-256-GCM notification model) — confirmed in Banking Circle's books;
ACI's card-gateway webhook, confirming a genuinely AES-256-GCM-encrypted
notification is built and delivery attempted; and Banking Circle's traps
and reset. It fails loudly if any hop is disconnected.

It plays the platform: every vendor is reached on its own surface with its
own login. What a platform could not do — seed trading, run a cycle now,
flip sanctions, land a wire, arm a trap, read a vendor's books — goes
through the lab API (`LAB_API_URL`, `LAB_API_TOKEN`), as an agent's would.
It never calls a control port or `/internal/*`.

`make e2e` runs it locally after `make up`; `make e2e-docker` runs
the same binary as one container attached to the compose network
(`E2E_NETWORK`). `E2E_ONLY=name,name` runs a few. See `docs/scenarios/`.
