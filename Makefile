# Why `up` tears down first under podman.
#
# podman-compose 1.x does not replace a container when its image changes:
# `up --build` builds a fresh binary and then keeps serving the old one. The
# failure is silent and it points somewhere else — a request body or a
# config field looks wrong when the truth is that the parser is older than
# the thing it is parsing.
#
# --force-recreate is not the fix. It removes and creates in one pass and
# races itself ("container name is already in use"), and it cannot replace a
# service others depend on ("has dependent containers which must be removed
# before it"). Both failures are noisy and partial, which is worse than
# either working or not.
#
# So: build, down, up. It costs a few seconds — the image layers are cached,
# only the containers are replaced — and it always runs what you just built.
# Named volumes survive `down`, so settlement-data and the console registry
# are not lost.
