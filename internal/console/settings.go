// The Configuration view.
//
// This lab's behaviour lives almost entirely in environment variables set
// in compose.yml plus two config files. Finding the one knob you want
// means grepping a 400-line compose file, so the console keeps a curated
// index of the ones that actually change what happens.
//
// What is shown live and what is only described is kept strictly apart.
// The console can read its own environment and the files mounted into it;
// it cannot read another container's environment, and claiming otherwise
// would be worse than not showing it -- an operator who trusts a stale
// value here will debug the wrong thing for an hour.

// Setting is one documented knob.

					Purpose: "Start of the morning (ER) delivery window."},
				{Key: "WORLDLINE_MORNING_FILE_WINDOW", Service: "worldline", Configured: "2h",

					Purpose: "The afternoon (AR) confirmation file. Retained, never reprocessed, and it moves no money."},
				{Key: "WORLDLINE_SETTLEMENT_DELAY", Service: "worldline", Configured: "24h",
					Purpose: "T+1. A cycle run today settles yesterday's transactions -- which is why seeding trading dated today then running a cycle produces nothing."},

					Purpose: "The safeguarding account named in the file's Settlement section, and where the lump sum is paid."},

					Purpose: "Divides every delay in the retry schedule. At 86400 the eleven-step story that really ends 48 hours after the first failure plays out in about four seconds. Set it to 1 for real timing."},
				{Key: "BC_SEED_BATCH_SIZE", Service: "banking-circle", Configured: "5",
					Purpose: "maxNotificationsPerMessage on the seeded convenience subscription. The documented minimum, so batching is visible rather than one-notification messages."},
				{Key: "BC_NOTIFICATION_KEY", Service: "banking-circle", Configured: "(a fake 32-char key)",
					Purpose: "The raw UTF-8 bytes of this 32-character key are the AES-256 key. Not base64-decoded -- a real integration gets this wrong once."},
