// Account identifiers.
//
// Banking Circle identifies an account by a UUID, and so does this
// simulation. That is not cosmetic. A client reads an account id out of
// its own configuration and puts it in a URL path, and the services in
// front of Banking Circle validate that path segment -- buddy's
// apps/banking-circle answers 400 "Validation failed (uuid is expected)"
// before the request ever leaves the platform. A lab that named its
// safeguarding account "bc_acc_sga_eur" therefore could not be reached
// through the platform's own Banking Circle service at all; it could only
// be reached by bypassing it, which meant the one code path the lab exists
// to exercise was the one path never taken.
//
// The ids below are obviously synthetic on sight -- a run of zeroes ending
// in the currency's ISO 4217 numeric code -- so nobody mistakes one for a
// real Banking Circle account, while still being structurally valid UUIDs
// that every validator in the chain accepts.

const (
	// SGAAccountEUR and SGAAccountGBP are the safeguarding accounts, one
	// per currency. 978 and 826 are EUR's and GBP's ISO 4217 numeric
	// codes, which is what makes these readable rather than arbitrary.

// AccountIDFor returns the Banking Circle account id for a stable external
// key -- a beneficiary id, a merchant IBAN, whatever the naming party
// happens to hold.
//
// In reality Banking Circle assigns account ids and a client stores the
// one it was given; nothing invents them. The lab has no onboarding call
// to hand them out, so the parties derive the same id from the same key
// instead. The effect a client sees is identical -- a UUID it did not
// choose, stable across restarts -- and, unlike a random id, two
// independent processes reach it without talking to each other, which is
// what lets B4B bridge a payout to the same account the harness then
// inspects.
//
// A key that is already a UUID is returned unchanged: when the platform
// has a real account id, that is the account, and re-deriving would send
// the money somewhere else.
