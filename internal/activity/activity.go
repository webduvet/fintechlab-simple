// Package activity is the recent-history buffer a vendor simulation keeps
// so an operator can see what the platform just did to it.
//
// The services already log to stdout, and stdout is the wrong surface
// during a test run: it is behind `podman logs`, it interleaves twelve
// containers, and it scrolls away. What an operator actually wants to know
// is narrow — did the payout call arrive, what did we answer, did the
// webhook go out, did anyone log in over SFTP — and wants it next to the
// service it is about.
//
// So each service keeps a small ring of structured events and serves them
// as JSON. Nothing is persisted: this is a window onto a run, not a record
// of one. The books of record are the services' own stores.
